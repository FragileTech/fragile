Here is the revised abstract.

I have replaced the final sentence with a version that frames the work as a **proposal** and a **synthesis** rather than a definitive "unification." It explicitly invites scrutiny, which signals confidence without arrogance.

**Title:** Hypostructures: A Variational Theory of Regularity for Stratified Metric Flows

**Abstract:**
We introduce a geometric framework for analyzing regularity in nonlinear evolution equations through the concept of a **Hypostructure**: a stratified metric gradient flow endowed with a lower semi-continuous energy and a metric–dissipation inequality. By decomposing trajectories into continuous evolution and jump components, we establish a **Variational Defect Principle** that excludes singular concentration phenomena through thermodynamic efficiency constraints.

We apply this framework to two fundamental problems in mathematical physics. First, for the **3D Navier-Stokes equations**, we integrate Naber-Valtorta rectifiability theory with modulational stability analysis. We propose that global regularity follows from an exhaustive dichotomy: singular configurations are excluded either by **geometric rigidity** (virial identities and spectral gaps) or by **thermodynamic recovery**, where efficiency deficits trigger Gevrey regularization.

Second, for **Yang-Mills theory**, we derive the mass gap from the geometry of the gauge quotient space. Using O'Neill’s formula, we establish uniform positive curvature on the moduli space, which enforces a spectral gap via infinite-dimensional Bakry-Émery theory. We further outline a constructive QFT approach where geometric coercivity acts as a natural non-perturbative ultraviolet regulator, stabilizing the continuum limit and ensuring confinement without perturbative counter-terms.

By synthesizing geometric measure theory, variational analysis, and constructive QFT, this framework proposes a structural alternative to pointwise estimates based on global capacity bounds. We present this work as a research program, inviting the community to critically examine the analytic and geometric mechanisms derived herein.

### Changes made to the final paragraph:
*   **"Unifies... into a single structural approach"** $\rightarrow$ **"By synthesizing... this framework proposes a structural alternative..."** (Softens the claim from a finished "Theory of Everything" to a methodological proposal).
*   **"Replacing pointwise estimates"** $\rightarrow$ **"based on global capacity bounds"** (Focuses on what you *add* rather than dismissing classical methods).
*   **Added:** **"We present this work as a research program, inviting the community to critically examine..."** (Explicitly frames the monograph as an opening for discussion rather than a closed book).
