================================================================================
PROOF PRIORITY MATRIX
================================================================================

CATEGORY A: CRITICAL MISSING (CORE FRAMEWORK)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These are fundamental results that anchor the entire framework:

1. Document: 15_geometric_gas_lsi_proof.md (Line 1279)
   Result: thm-adaptive-lsi-main
   Title: N-Uniform Log-Sobolev Inequality for Geometric Viscous Fluid Model
   Impact: CRITICAL - Resolves Framework Conjecture 8.3
   Why: This proves exponential KL-convergence with explicit parameter bounds
   
2. Document: 11_geometric_gas.md (Multiple)
   Results: 26 missing proofs including:
     - thm-lsi-adaptive-gas: N-Uniform LSI (alternative to #1)
     - thm-signal-generation-adaptive: Adaptive signal generation
     - thm-keystone-adaptive: Keystone principle extension
   Impact: HIGH - These are the "convergence guarantees"
   Why: Without these, the adaptive mechanisms lack theoretical backing

3. Document: 16_convergence_mean_field.md (Multiple - 26 items)
   Results: QSD existence, stability, mean-field limits
   Impact: HIGH-MEDIUM - Completes the convergence story
   Why: Bridges finite-N dynamics to continuum limits
   Note: This is the MOST DEMANDING document

CATEGORY B: IMPORTANT REGULARITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These establish smoothness required for analysis:

4. Document: 19_geometric_gas_cinf_regularity_simplified.md (22 items)
   Result: C∞ Regularity proof (simplified version)
   Impact: MEDIUM - Reference is in document 20 (complete)
   Why: The "simplified" version should be readable but is currently empty
   Note: Consider consolidating with document 20

5. Document: 13_geometric_gas_c3_regularity.md (Line 199)
   Result: lem-telescoping-derivatives
   Impact: LOW - Supporting lemma for main C3 result
   Why: 94% of document complete, just one telescoping identity needed

CATEGORY C: MISSING CROSS-REFERENCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These reference external results or need clarification:

6. Document: 18_emergent_geometry.md (4 items)
   Results: 4 main convergence results
   Impact: MEDIUM - Geometric interpretation results
   Why: Most proofs reference earlier documents correctly; 4 need verification

7. Document: 17_qsd_exchangeability_geometric.md (1 item)
   Result: thm-lsi-geometric
   Impact: LOW - Likely same as 15_geometric_gas_lsi_proof result

================================================================================
ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

PHASE 1: CRITICAL PATH (Weeks 1-2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These are blockers for framework completeness:

1. HIGHEST: Prove thm-adaptive-lsi-main in 15_geometric_gas_lsi_proof.md
   - Location: Line 1279
   - What's needed: Complete proof of N-uniform LSI
   - Why: Resolves Framework Conjecture 8.3; proves exponential convergence
   - Estimated effort: HIGH - This is a major theoretical result
   - Approach: Use hypocoercivity + state-dependent diffusion bounds from Doc 13-14

2. HIGH: Complete 26 missing proofs in 11_geometric_gas.md
   - Focus on: thm-lsi-adaptive-gas, thm-signal-generation-adaptive, thm-keystone-adaptive
   - Why: These establish stability of the core adaptive model
   - Estimated effort: MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Many may be "section proofs" that reference Part I documents

3. MEDIUM: Fix 19_geometric_gas_cinf_regularity_simplified.md (22 items)
   - Option A: Complete the simplified proof (inductive framework)
   - Option B: Mark as "see full version in document 20" with references
   - Why: Currently 95% empty despite being introduced as "simplified"
   - Estimated effort: MEDIUM (if completing) or LOW (if consolidating)

PHASE 2: CONVERGENCE THEORY (Weeks 2-3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Most demanding section; requires specialized knowledge:

4. HIGH: Complete 26 proofs in 16_convergence_mean_field.md
   - Critical path: QSD existence → stability → smoothness → convergence rate
   - Why: Establishes mean-field limits and explicit convergence rates
   - Estimated effort: VERY HIGH - Requires hypoellipticity, LSI, QSD theory
   - Note: This uses recent results (Champagnat-Villemonais, etc.)
   - Dependencies: Must complete items in Phase 1 first

5. MEDIUM: Fix 3 sketches in 20_geometric_gas_cinf_regularity_full.md
   - Results: 3 lemmas with TODO markers
   - Why: Document is otherwise 90% complete
   - Estimated effort: LOW-MEDIUM
   - Approach: Review existing proofs for similar techniques

PHASE 3: VERIFICATION & POLISH (Week 3+)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Final documentation checks:

6. LOW: Verify cross-references in 18_emergent_geometry.md (4 items)
   - Why: Mostly complete; just needs label verification
   - Estimated effort: LOW

7. LOW: Verify 17_qsd_exchangeability_geometric.md cross-reference
   - Why: Single LSI result should align with document 15
   - Estimated effort: LOW

================================================================================
NOTES ON MISSING PROOFS
================================================================================

Common patterns in "needs proof" statements:

1. REFERENCE PROOFS
   Many "needs proof" items actually say "See Document X" or "From Axioms"
   - These may not need NEW proofs, just cross-references verified
   - Examples: thm-c1-c4-established items in document 19

2. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
   Some are marked "(Conditional)" because they depend on external results
   - Example: "Brascamp-Lieb Inequality (Conditional)" 
   - These are correct as-is; they make explicit what's needed

3. CONJECTURAL RESULTS
   A few marked as "(Conjecture)" - these are intentional
   - Example: Wasserstein contraction for proportional resampling
   - These are research problems, not bugs

4. INFORMAL STATEMENTS
   Some are intentionally informal (e.g., "Main Theorem (Informal)")
   - These are meant as overview statements
   - Formal versions exist elsewhere in the document

5. VERIFICATION STATUS TAGS
   Some are marked "(VERIFIED)", "(PROVEN)", "(CHECKED)"
   - These suggest proofs exist but may be in adjacent sections
   - May need to be moved next to the theorem statement

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FRAMEWORK COMPLETION
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This week):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Review Document 15 (LSI Proof) - the 2 missing proofs are the highest value items
2. Triage Document 19 - decide whether to complete it or consolidate with Document 20
3. Run Gemini review on the 3 sketches in Document 20

SHORT-TERM (Next 1-2 weeks):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Complete the 26 missing proofs in Document 11 (prioritize convergence results)
2. Formalize the 26 convergence results in Document 16 (high complexity)
3. Verify cross-references across all documents

LONG-TERM (Framework stability):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Create "Proof Status Dashboard" to track completion
2. Use Gemini for collaborative review (as per CLAUDE.md protocols)
3. Consider publishing individual chapters as preprints when complete
4. Build proof verification test suite for automated checking

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Use the CLAUDE.md dual-review protocol (Gemini + Codex) for all new proofs
- Verify all mathematical notation matches the glossary (docs/glossary.md)
- Cross-reference with Part I documents (Euclidean Gas, 01-09)
- Test discretization schemes (BAOAB integrator) against proofs
