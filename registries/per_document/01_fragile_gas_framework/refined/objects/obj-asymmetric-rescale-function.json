  "definition": "A function that transforms standardized Z-scores into positive values used for calculating fitness potential. It is constructed from exponential and logarithmic segments that are smoothly joined by a unique cubic polynomial patch, P(z), ensuring the overall function is continuously differentiable.",
  "mathematical_properties": "The function is C^1 smooth, monotonically non-decreasing, has a uniformly bounded range (0, g_A,max], and is globally Lipschitz continuous with a Lipschitz constant of approximately 1.0054. These properties ensure that the fitness potential is a well-behaved, stable function of the standardized scores.",

    "z_max": "Must be a value greater than 1 for the piecewise definition to be well-posed."
