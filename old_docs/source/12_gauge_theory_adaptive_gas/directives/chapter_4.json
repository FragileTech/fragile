This means:\n760: - Information transported from walker $i$ around the triangle returns relabeled\n761: - The relabeling depends on the specific path taken (clockwise vs. counterclockwise)\n762: - The emergent metric $g(x, S)$ has anisotropy that couples to the discrete gauge structure\n763: \n764: **Physical consequence**: Curvature quantifies how much the **local geometry** of the fitness landscape (encoded in the algorithmic distance metric) creates **non-abelian coupling** between walkers. In flat regions (constant $H$), curvature vanishes; near peaks or valleys with varying curvature, the gauge connection twists."
