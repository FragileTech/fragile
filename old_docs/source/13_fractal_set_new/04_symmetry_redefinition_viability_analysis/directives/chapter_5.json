The algorithmic distance d_alg(i,k) = \u221a(||x_i - x_k||\u00b2 + \u03bb_alg ||v_i - v_k||\u00b2) is a **physical separation** in phase space.

The raw reward r_i = R(x_i, v_i) - c_v_reg ||v_i||\u00b2 is a **physical observable**. The environment reward R and kinetic energy are measurable quantities.

The swarm statistics \u03bc_d, \u03c3'_d, \u03bc_r, \u03c3'_r are computed as averages and standard deviations of the gauge-invariant quantities d_i and r_i. Averaging gauge-invariant quantities yields gauge-invariant statistics. Therefore: **\u03bc_d, \u03c3'_d, \u03bc_r, \u03c3'_r are gauge-invariant**.\n760: \n761: 4. The z-scores z_d,i = (d_i - \u03bc_d) / \u03c3'_d and z_r,i = (r_i - \u03bc_r) / \u03c3'_r are ratios of gauge-invariant quantities.
