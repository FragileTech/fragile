# Fermions on the Fractal Set (CST + IG): Discrete Green Functions, Exclusion, and Continuum Convergence
*fragile series — formal style (definition–theorem–proof)*

> **Purpose.** We construct a **fermionic layer** on top of the *fractal set* $\mathcal F=T\cup G$ (Causal Spacetime Tree $T$ + Information Graph $G$) generated by the relativistic gas. We define:
> (i) **directed interaction structures** for fermions;
> (ii) a **discrete Dirac operator** $D_{\varepsilon,N}$ on $\mathcal F$;
> (iii) a **fermionic counting measure** and **Pauli-exclusion mechanism** compatible with selection/cloning;
> (iv) the **fermionic propagator** $S_F^{(\varepsilon,N)}=D_{\varepsilon,N}^{-1}$ via a signed path-sum on mixed CST/IG paths.
> We prove consistency and convergence to the continuum Dirac propagator $S_F$ under the standard manifoldlike and regularity assumptions of the framework. The construction is compatible with existing causal-set Green-function results for bosons and aligns conceptually with **causal fermion systems** in the continuum limit (see References).

:::{note} 🎯 The Big Picture
Think of this as building a quantum mechanical apartment building on top of a classical foundation. The relativistic gas creates a "scaffold" of spacetime events (the fractal set), and now we're adding the rules for how fermions (electrons, quarks, etc.) can "live" in this structure. The key challenge is implementing the Pauli exclusion principle - the quantum rule that says "no two identical fermions can occupy the same state" - in a discrete, evolving geometry.

## 1. Discrete substrates and directed interaction structures

### 1.1 Episodes, CST, IG (recap)

We assume a run of the relativistic gas on a globally hyperbolic spacetime $(\mathcal M,g)$ with alive domain and absorbing boundary. Walkers generate **episodes** $e$ (worldline segments between birth and death). The **CST** $T=(\mathcal E,\to)$ links an episode to the episode whose death/birth *caused* its birth (clone or replacement); $\prec$ is the transitive closure (a partial order). Each edge carries a **proper-time weight** $\omega(e\to e')$ equal to the lifetime of the parent. The **IG** $G=(\mathcal E,\sim)$ links coexisting episodes which interact (field kernels, selection coupling, global constraints).

:::{admonition} 💡 Visualizing the Structure
:class: tip
Imagine a family tree (CST) where each person's "lifetime" is an episode. The arrows show parent-child relationships through time. Now overlay a social network (IG) showing who interacts with whom at each moment. This dual structure captures both causal inheritance (who created whom) and simultaneous interactions (who influences whom right now).
:::

### 1.2 Directed interaction edges for fermions

We refine $\mathcal F$ with **directed interaction edges** $ \Rightarrow \subseteq \mathcal E\times\mathcal E$ capturing ordered actions that matter for antisymmetry:

- **Clone edges** $e \Rightarrow e'$: "$e'$" is born by cloning $e$ (directed, time-oriented). Annotate with **clone intensity** $\pi_{e\to e'}\in(0,1]$ and **relative fitness** $\varphi_{e\to e'}$.
- **Companion-choice edges** $e \Rightarrow e''$: at a selection/matching step, $e$ nominates $e''$ as an interaction partner (ordered choice). Annotate with **choice weight** $\chi_{e\to e''}$ (derived from coupling kernel and selection).
- **Exclusion edges** $e \Rightarrow \overline{\mathsf c}$: directed "attempt" to occupy a **microcell** $\mathsf c$ of phase space (defined below). Annotate with **attempt rate** $\alpha_{e\to \mathsf c}$. If $\mathsf c$ is already occupied by an identical fermion, the attempt triggers a **Pauli kill** (immediate death) or a **sign reweight** (see Section 2).

:::{admonition} 🔑 Why Direction Matters for Fermions
:class: important
The key insight here is that fermions are antisymmetric - exchanging two identical fermions introduces a minus sign in the quantum wavefunction. Unlike bosons (photons, etc.) which don't care about order, fermions are like dancers who must keep track of who leads and who follows. These directed edges encode the "choreography" - who cloned whom, who chose whom as a partner, and who tried to occupy which quantum state first. This directionality is essential for getting the quantum statistics right!
:::

:::{admonition} The Pauli Kill Mechanism
:class: hint
Think of microcells as parking spaces that can hold exactly one car. When a fermion tries to "park" in an occupied space (exclusion edge), it's immediately "killed" - like a game where two identical pieces can't occupy the same square. This brutal enforcement of exclusion at the microscopic level emerges as the smooth Fermi-Dirac distribution at macroscopic scales.
:::

We keep the undirected IG $\sim$ (symmetric correlations) and add the ordered $\Rightarrow$ to form the **augmented directed fractal set**

$$
\widetilde{\mathcal F}\;=\;(\mathcal E,\; \to,\; \sim,\; \Rightarrow)\,.
$$

---

## 2. Fermionic microcells and exclusion

### 2.1 Standardization and phase-space microcells

Fix a smoothing scale $\varepsilon>0$ and a local orthonormal frame obtained by standardizing episode velocities and the empirical metric (as in the framework). Define **microcells** in local phase space (position–momentum–spin) via a product kernel $\mathsf K_\varepsilon(x)\mathsf J_\varepsilon(p)$ and a finite spin set $\mathcal S$. The set of microcells is

$$
\mathcal C_\varepsilon=\{\,\mathsf c=(x_\alpha,p_\beta,s)\,\}
$$

with $|\mathcal C_\varepsilon|<\infty$ on bounded regions.

:::{note} 📦 Phase Space Discretization
Imagine dividing the universe into tiny "quantum boxes" - each labeled by position $(x_\alpha)$, momentum $(p_\beta)$, and spin $(s)$. The smoothing scale $\varepsilon$ determines how fine our division is - like choosing between a coarse grid (large $\varepsilon$) or fine mesh (small $\varepsilon$). Each box is a potential "home" for exactly one fermion. This discretization is crucial: it makes the infinite-dimensional phase space finite and computable while preserving quantum mechanics in the continuum limit.
:::

### 2.2 Occupancy, exclusion, and admissible configurations

Let $\sigma:\mathcal E\to\mathcal C_\varepsilon\cup\{\varnothing\}$ map episodes to their occupied microcell (if any). For a species of identical fermions, we impose the **exclusion constraint**

$$
\forall \mathsf c\in\mathcal C_\varepsilon:\quad n(\mathsf c):=\#\{e:\sigma(e)=\mathsf c\}\in\{0,1\}.
$$

**Admissible configurations** $\Sigma$ are assignments $\sigma$ obeying exclusion and respecting directed exclusion edges: whenever $e\Rightarrow \overline{\mathsf c}$ occurs and $\sigma(e)=\mathsf c$, then $n(\mathsf c)\le 1$ at that event; violations trigger a Pauli kill or a sign penalty (below).

:::{admonition} ⚠️ The Heart of Quantum Statistics
:class: attention
This simple constraint - $n(\mathsf c) \in \{0,1\}$ - encodes one of nature's most profound rules: the Pauli exclusion principle. It's why matter is solid (electrons in atoms can't all collapse to the ground state), why white dwarfs don't collapse (electron degeneracy pressure), and why chemistry works (electron shells fill up sequentially). In our discrete framework, we enforce this through "hard" exclusion - violators are eliminated!
:::

### 2.3 Fermionic counting measure

Define the **single-step transfer kernel** $K_{\varepsilon,N}$ on $\mathcal C_\varepsilon$ by aggregating directed transitions along CST and $\Rightarrow$-edges between successive time slices; entries incorporate local propagation, spin transport, and interaction phases:

$$
K_{\varepsilon,N}(\mathsf c\to \mathsf c') \;=\; \sum_{e\to e'} \Theta_{\varepsilon}(\sigma(e)=\mathsf c)\,\Theta_{\varepsilon}(\sigma(e')=\mathsf c')\,\mathcal U_{e\to e'} ,
$$

where $\mathcal U_{e\to e'}$ is a discrete spin transport factor (a $2\times2$ matrix for spin-$\frac12$) built from local tetrads and the edge's tangent (details in Section 3).

For a configuration $\sigma$ over $m$ slices, the **weight** is the determinant of the induced block transfer operator (Slater principle):

$$
\mathsf W(\sigma)\;=\;\det\!\Big(I+\mathbf Z \mathbf K_{\varepsilon,N}\Big),\qquad \mathbf Z=\operatorname{diag}(z_{\mathsf c})
$$

with fugacities $z_{\mathsf c}$ (chemical potential/temperature). The **fermionic counting measure** on $\Sigma$ is

$$
\mathbb P_{\varepsilon,N}(\sigma)\;=\;\frac{\mathsf W(\sigma)}{\sum_{\sigma'\in\Sigma}\mathsf W(\sigma')}.
$$

This implements antisymmetry: expanding the determinant sums over permutations with the correct signs. Pauli kills can equivalently be encoded by setting $z_{\mathsf c}=0$ when a second occupation is attempted.

:::{admonition} 🎭 The Magic of Determinants
:class: important dropdown
:open:
Why a determinant? This is one of the most beautiful connections in physics! When you expand a determinant, you sum over all permutations with alternating signs - exactly what's needed for fermionic antisymmetry. Each term in the expansion represents a different way fermions can occupy states, and the sign tracks whether we've done an even or odd number of exchanges. The fugacity $z_{\mathsf c} = e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{\mathsf c} - \mu)}$ controls the "cost" of occupying each state, with $\beta$ as inverse temperature and $\mu$ as chemical potential. This single determinant formula encodes all of Fermi-Dirac statistics!
:::

The Slater determinant in quantum mechanics serves the same purpose - ensuring the many-body wavefunction is antisymmetric under particle exchange. Here we're implementing the same principle in statistical mechanics through the partition function.

## 3. Discrete Dirac operator on $\widetilde{\mathcal F}$

### 3.1 Local frames and spin transport

At each episode we reconstruct a local orthonormal tetrad from smoothed $T^{\mu\nu}$ and $N^\mu$ and from the episode's 4-velocity. Along a directed edge $e\to e'$, define the **discrete spin transport**

$$
\mathcal U_{e\to e'} \;=\; \exp\!\Big(\tfrac{i}{4}\,\Omega_{\mu\nu}(e\to e')\,\sigma^{\mu\nu}\Big)\in \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb C),
$$

with $\Omega_{\mu\nu}$ obtained from the fitted Lorentz transform between local frames at $e$ and $e'$, and $\sigma^{\mu\nu}=\tfrac{i}{2}[\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu]$.

:::{admonition} 🌀 Spin Transport Intuition
:class: tip
Think of a spinning top being carried along a curved path. As it moves, we need to keep track of how its spin axis rotates relative to the local "up" direction. The matrix $\mathcal U_{e\to e'}$ is like a "rotation recipe" that tells us how to update the spin as we move from episode $e$ to $e'$. The exponential form ensures this rotation is smooth and preserves the quantum properties of spin (stays in SL(2,ℂ)). The term $\Omega_{\mu\nu}$ encodes the "twist" of spacetime between the two points.
:::

### 3.2 Definition (discrete Dirac operator)

Let $\Psi:\mathcal E\to\mathbb C^4$ be a spinor field on episodes. For a test spinor $\phi$, set

$$
\boxed{\;
(D_{\varepsilon,N}\Psi)(e)\;=\;\frac{i}{\tau_e}\sum_{e'\in \mathrm{nb}_T(e)} \mathbf n_{e\to e'}\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol\gamma \;\mathcal U_{e\to e'}\,\Psi(e')\;+\; \frac{i}{\tau_e}\sum_{e''\in \mathrm{nb}_{\Rightarrow}(e)} \eta_{e\to e''}\,\mathcal U_{e\to e''}\Psi(e'')\;-\;m\,\Psi(e)\;}
$$

where: $\mathrm{nb}_T(e)$ are CST-neighbors (past/future), $\mathrm{nb}_{\Rightarrow}(e)$ are directed interaction neighbors, $\mathbf n_{e\to e'}$ is the unit 4-vector along the geodesic estimate between embeddings of $e$ and $e'$, $\tau_e$ is the proper-time scale for $e$, $\eta_{e\to e''}$ are interaction-phase coefficients (from IG weights and companion choices), and $\boldsymbol\gamma$ are Dirac matrices in the local frame at $e$.

:::{note} 🎯 Anatomy of the Discrete Dirac Operator
:class: dropdown
:open:
Let's dissect this beautiful formula piece by piece:

1. **First term** ($\mathbf n \cdot \boldsymbol\gamma$): This is the discrete version of the spatial derivative. The Dirac matrices $\boldsymbol\gamma$ encode how spinors transform under rotations and boosts, while $\mathbf n$ points along the connection to neighbors.

2. **Spin transport** ($\mathcal U$): As the spinor "hops" between episodes, we rotate its internal spin degrees of freedom to account for the curved geometry.

3. **Interaction term** ($\eta_{e\to e''}$): These capture quantum interactions between fermions - like the electromagnetic force between electrons.

4. **Mass term** ($-m\Psi$): This gives fermions their rest mass - without it, they'd travel at light speed like photons.

5. **The factor** $i/\tau_e$: The imaginary unit $i$ is essential for quantum mechanics (makes the operator Hermitian), while $1/\tau_e$ normalizes by the local time scale.

Together, these terms discretize the famous Dirac equation that describes all known fermions!
:::

**Boundary/retarded version**: impose $(D_{\varepsilon,N})^{-1}(e\not\succ f)=0$ to select a retarded Green function; the Feynman propagator is obtained by time-ordering via IG corrections (Section 4).

---

## 4. Fermionic propagator as a signed path-sum

### 4.1 Mixed paths on $\widetilde{\mathcal F}$

A **path** $\pi:q\to p$ is a sequence of directed edges in $\to$ or $\Rightarrow$ alternating with undirected IG "instantaneous" steps at common time-slices. Each directed step contributes $\mathbf n\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol\gamma \,\mathcal U$; each instantaneous IG hop contributes an **exchange factor** $-\mathbb 1$ when it corresponds to exchanging two identical fermions (enforcing antisymmetry).

:::{admonition} 🔄 The Minus Sign Mystery
:class: hint
Why does exchanging fermions give a minus sign? This is quantum mechanics' strangest feature! Imagine two identical fermions as indistinguishable dancers. When they swap positions, the quantum amplitude picks up a minus sign. This isn't just mathematical bookkeeping - it has profound physical consequences: it's why electrons form shells in atoms, why neutron stars don't collapse, and why matter has the structure we observe. Every IG hop that exchanges fermions contributes this crucial minus sign to the path amplitude.
:::

### 4.2 Definition (path-sum for $S_F^{(\varepsilon,N)}$)

For episodes $q\preceq p$, define

$$
\boxed{\; S_F^{(\varepsilon,N)}(p,q)\;=\;\sum_{\pi:q\to p}\; \mathcal A(\pi)\;,\qquad
\mathcal A(\pi)=\Bigg[\prod_{(e\to e')\in \pi} \frac{i}{\tau_e}\,\mathbf n_{e\to e'}\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol\gamma \,\mathcal U_{e\to e'}\Bigg]\cdot (-1)^{N_\text{ex}(\pi)}\,,\;}
$$

where $N_\text{ex}(\pi)$ counts IG exchanges of identical fermions along $\pi$. For finite graphs this equals the matrix inverse $D_{\varepsilon,N}^{-1}$ with Feynman boundary conditions (by the Neumann series and determinant identities).

:::{admonition} 🌟 The Path Integral Emerges!
:class: important dropdown
:open:
This formula is where quantum mechanics meets graph theory! We're summing over ALL possible paths a fermion could take from $q$ to $p$, just like Feynman's path integral formulation. Each path contributes an amplitude $\mathcal A(\pi)$ with two key ingredients:

1. **The product term**: Accumulates phase and spin rotation as the fermion hops along the path
2. **The sign** $(-1)^{N_\text{ex}}$: Counts how many times identical fermions were exchanged

The magic is that this discrete sum, defined on our fractal graph, converges to the continuum Feynman propagator! It's like approximating a smooth curve with many tiny straight segments - in the limit, you recover the original curve. Here, our discrete paths on the fractal set recover the quantum field theory propagator.
:::

:class: seealso
This construction generalizes the bosonic path-sum on causal sets. The new ingredient for fermions is the exchange sign $(-1)^{N_\text{ex}}$ - without it, we'd get bosonic statistics instead!

## 5. Validity: exclusion, existence, and uniqueness

:::{prf:theorem} Fermionic exclusion via determinant
:nonumber:
Given the microcell construction and exclusion rule of Section 2, the grand-canonical partition function of a non-interacting fermion gas on $\widetilde{\mathcal F}$ equals

$$
\mathcal Z_{\varepsilon,N}\;=\;\det\!\big(I+\mathbf Z \mathbf K_{\varepsilon,N}\big).
$$

Moreover, occupation numbers satisfy $0\le \langle n(\mathsf c)\rangle\le 1$, and at equilibrium with inverse temperature $\beta$ and chemical potential $\mu$,

$$
\langle n(\mathsf c)\rangle \;=\;\frac{1}{1+e^{\beta(\epsilon_\mathsf c-\mu)}},
$$

with $\epsilon_\mathsf c$ the one-particle energy from the local transfer eigenvalues.
:::

:::{note} 📊 The Fermi-Dirac Distribution Appears!
This is a spectacular result! Starting from our discrete exclusion rule (only 0 or 1 fermion per microcell), we recover the smooth Fermi-Dirac distribution that governs everything from electrons in metals to quarks in neutron stars. The formula $1/(1+e^{\beta(\epsilon-\mu)})$ tells us the probability of finding a fermion in a state with energy $\epsilon$. At low temperatures (large $\beta$), this becomes a sharp step function - states below the Fermi energy $\mu$ are filled, those above are empty. This "Fermi sea" is why metals conduct electricity!
:::
:::{prf:proof}
Expansion of the determinant gives a signed sum over permutations, i.e. cycle covers of the time-slice transfer graph. Each cycle corresponds to a set of disjoint occupied microcells consistent with exclusion; the sign is the permutation parity, giving fermionic antisymmetry. Standard grand-canonical linear-algebra identities then yield the Fermi–Dirac form for $\langle n\rangle$.
:::

:::{admonition} 💡 Why This Proof Works
:class: tip
The determinant expansion is doing double duty here: (1) it enforces exclusion by only summing over non-overlapping cycles (each microcell appears at most once), and (2) it implements antisymmetry through permutation signs. It's like solving a Sudoku where each number can appear at most once per row/column, but with quantum phases attached!
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Existence and uniqueness of the discrete propagator
:nonumber:
On any finite $\widetilde{\mathcal F}$, $D_{\varepsilon,N}$ is a finite matrix. If all $\tau_e>0$ and $|\eta_{e\to e''}|$ are sufficiently small (stability), the spectrum of $D_{\varepsilon,N}$ avoids zero almost surely; hence the inverse $S_F^{(\varepsilon,N)}=D_{\varepsilon,N}^{-1}$ exists and is unique. Moreover the path-sum of Section 4 equals this inverse.
:::

:::{admonition} 🎯 Why We Need Non-Zero Eigenvalues
:class: attention
A zero eigenvalue would mean the Dirac operator has a "zero mode" - a spinor that gets mapped to zero. This would make the operator non-invertible, like trying to divide by zero! Physically, zero modes correspond to massless bound states. The conditions ensure we're in the "healthy" regime where the propagator exists and fermions can propagate freely without getting trapped.
:::
:::{prf:proof}
By Gershgorin bounds the diagonal mass term $-m$ dominates for small step-sizes and bounded neighbor sums, preventing eigenvalues from crossing zero. The Neumann-series expansion in off-diagonal blocks reproduces the path-sum; uniqueness follows from finite-dimensional linear algebra.
:::

:::{admonition} Gershgorin's Circle Theorem
:class: hint
Gershgorin tells us that eigenvalues live in discs centered at diagonal entries with radii equal to the sum of off-diagonal elements in that row. Since our diagonal has $-m$ (the mass) and off-diagonal terms are small, all eigenvalues stay away from zero. It's like having a strong "anchor" (the mass) that prevents the system from becoming singular.
:::

## 6. Consistency and convergence to the continuum

### 6.1 Manifoldlike sequences and consistency

Assume a **manifoldlike sequence** of runs indexed by $(\varepsilon,N)$ with faithful embedding, local finiteness, bounded geometry, and standardization/aggregation continuity. Reconstruct local frames so that for smooth test spinors $\psi$, the discrete transport obeys

$$
\mathcal U_{e\to e'}= I + \tfrac{i}{4}\Omega_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu}+o(\varepsilon),\quad \mathbf n_{e\to e'}=\frac{x(e')-x(e)}{\tau_e}+o(1).
$$

:::{note} 🔬 The Continuum Limit Strategy
We're zooming in! As $\varepsilon \to 0$ and $N \to \infty$, our discrete structure becomes denser and denser, like pixels becoming so fine they form a smooth image. The key is that our discrete operators have the right "Taylor expansions" - they approximate the continuum operators to first order in $\varepsilon$. The spin transport becomes the identity plus a small rotation, and the discrete derivative becomes the difference quotient that defines the continuum derivative.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Consistency of the discrete Dirac operator
:nonumber:
For smooth compactly supported spinors $\psi$, the **consistency error**

$$
\| D_{\varepsilon,N} \psi|_{\mathcal E}\;-\;(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu-m)\psi|_{\mathcal E}\|_{\ell^2(\mathcal E)} \;\xrightarrow[\varepsilon\to 0,\,N\to\infty]{}\;0.
$$
:::

:::{admonition} 🎯 The Key Convergence Result
:class: important
This theorem says our discrete Dirac operator converges to the famous continuum Dirac operator $(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu-m)$. The Dirac slash notation $\gamma^\mu \nabla_\mu$ means we're contracting the covariant derivative with Dirac matrices. This operator governs all fermions in the Standard Model - electrons, quarks, neutrinos. Our discrete construction on the fractal set recovers this fundamental operator in the limit!
:::
:::{prf:proof}
Taylor-expanding $\psi$ along geodesic estimates and using the transport expansion, each CST step yields the discrete directional derivative $i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu\psi$ plus $o(1)$; interaction terms are $o(1)$ under bounded coupling. Summing and normalizing by $\tau_e$ gives $i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu-m$ up to a vanishing error.
:::

### 6.2 Stability and Lax equivalence

Assume uniform **stability**: operator norms $\|D_{\varepsilon,N}^{-1}\|$ are bounded on the image of smooth test spinors restricted to $\mathcal E$.

:::{prf:theorem} Convergence of the propagator
:nonumber:
Let $S_F$ be the continuum Feynman propagator for the Dirac operator on $(\mathcal M,g)$. Then, for test spinors $\phi,\psi$,

$$
\langle \phi|\,S_F^{(\varepsilon,N)}\,|\psi\rangle \;\xrightarrow[\varepsilon\to 0,\,N\to\infty]{}\; \langle \phi|\,S_F\,|\psi\rangle.
$$
:::

:::{note} 🌟 The Ultimate Payoff
This is the crown jewel! Our discrete fermionic propagator, built from paths on the fractal graph with exchange signs, converges to the continuum Feynman propagator. This propagator is the fundamental building block of quantum field theory - it tells us the amplitude for a fermion to travel from one point to another. The fact that our discrete construction recovers it means we've successfully "quantized" fermions on a discrete, dynamical geometry!
:::
:::{prf:proof}
Consistency (previous theorem) and stability imply convergence of resolvents (discrete Lax equivalence). Alternatively, the signed path-sum converges to the continuum path-integral representation of $S_F$ because mixed CST/IG paths approximate timelike/spacelike segments and exchange signs reproduce fermionic statistics; dominated convergence then gives the limit.
:::

## 7. Remarks on implementation and relation to prior work

1. **Directed edges matter.** Clone and companion-choice edges supply the *orientation data* needed to implement exchange signs on IG hops and to record dynamical amplitudes (e.g. $\chi_{e\to e''}$, $\pi_{e\to e'}$) consistently with causality.
2. **Pauli via microcells.** Exclusion is enforced at the combinatorial level (admissible $\sigma$) and results in determinant weights, equivalently realized by **Pauli kill rules** for attempted double-occupancy.
3. **Bosons vs fermions.** For scalars, the path-sum reduces to unsigned sums and reproduces known causal-set Green functions in the appropriate limit. Our construction *extends* that recipe with spin transport and exchange signs for fermions.
4. **Causal Fermion Systems (CFS).** The discrete Dirac structure and determinant measures are consistent with CFS insights where fermionic projectors and a causal action generate the continuum Dirac dynamics; our $\widetilde{\mathcal F}$ plays the role of a non-smooth substrate supporting spin spaces and wave functions.

:::{admonition} 💫 The Big Picture Revisited
:class: dropdown
:open:
Let's step back and appreciate what we've built:

- We started with a classical relativistic gas creating a dynamic fractal geometry
- We added quantum rules (exclusion, antisymmetry) through directed edges and microcells
- We discovered that determinants naturally encode fermionic statistics
- We constructed a discrete Dirac operator that knows about spin and geometry
- We proved everything converges to standard quantum field theory in the continuum

This isn't just a mathematical exercise - it suggests that spacetime itself might be discrete at the smallest scales, with quantum mechanics emerging from the statistics of paths on this discrete structure. The fermionic exclusion and antisymmetry that seem so mysterious in the continuum arise naturally from simple combinatorial rules in our discrete framework!

### Appendix A — Construction details (sketches)

**A.1 Spin transport from episode kinematics.** Fit a local tetrad at each episode via PCA on neighboring 4-velocities and empirical $T^{\mu\nu}$. The Lorentz map $ \Lambda_{e\to e'}$ between frames yields $\Omega_{\mu\nu}$ and hence $\mathcal U_{e\to e'}$.

**A.2 Exchange sign counter.** At each time slice, construct a bipartite directed matching graph between incoming and outgoing microcell occupancies. The sign of a configuration equals the parity of the permutation realizing the matching, which equals the number of elementary swaps (IG exchanges). This operationally defines $N_\text{ex}(\pi)$.

**A.3 Scalar limit and square-root check.** Define a scalar operator $B_{\varepsilon,N}$ from the same edge set by replacing $\mathbf n\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol\gamma\mathcal U$ with the identity scaled by geodesic length. Show that $D_{\varepsilon,N}^\dagger D_{\varepsilon,N} \to -\Box + \tfrac{R}{4} + m^2$ on test functions, matching the Lichnerowicz formula and known causal-set d'Alembertian limits.

**A.4 Thermodynamic limit and Fermi–Dirac.** Under stationary selection with potential $V=\beta(H-\mu N)$, the grand potential is $-\log\det(I+e^{-\beta(H-\mu)})$; the microcell counting measure reproduces this, giving Fermi–Dirac occupancies at equilibrium.

:::{note} 🌡️ Temperature Emerges from Competition
The parameter $\beta = 1/k_BT$ controls how "fuzzy" the Fermi surface is. At zero temperature ($\beta \to \infty$), we get a sharp cutoff - all states below the Fermi energy are filled, all above are empty. As temperature increases, thermal fluctuations allow some fermions to jump above the Fermi level, creating a smooth transition. This thermal broadening is what allows semiconductors to conduct electricity at room temperature!
