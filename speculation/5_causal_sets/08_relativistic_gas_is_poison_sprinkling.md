Below is a **self‑contained proof document** showing that the **Relativistic Gas (RG)** sampler in your framework satisfies the conditions required for a **valid causal‑set sampling algorithm**. I prove that, under the hypotheses already established in your files (finite‑range locality, label invariance/covariance, Poissonian jump structure from the minimum‑action derivation, Doob‑normalized QSD), the set of “episodes” produced by the RG is a **Poisson sprinkling** (homogeneous or inhomogeneous), so that the induced partial order on the Causal Spacetime Tree (CST) is a **locally finite causal set** with a **faithful embedding**. I also state the inhomogeneous variant (curved backgrounds / spatially varying QSD density), which still yields a Poisson process with intensity $\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g$.

> **Notation.**
> $M$ is a globally hyperbolic spacetime region with volume element $d\mathrm{Vol}_g$; $\mathcal U M$ denotes the unit tangent bundle with Sasaki metric (used only for dynamics). “Episodes” are the spacetime marks of walkers’ birth/kill genealogies; the **CST** is the directed acyclic genealogy. The **IG** is the finite‑range interaction kernel used by the algorithm but is **not** used to define the causal order.

## 0) What must be shown (conditions A1–A5)

I use the sufficient conditions introduced earlier:

* **A1 (Locality / Bell causality in growth).** Sampling in a region $A\subset M$ is unaffected by updates restricted to regions spacelike to $A$.
* **A2 (Covariance / label invariance).** The sampling law is invariant under isometries (in distribution) and under relabelings of episodes.
* **A3 (Intensity proportional to volume).** $\mathbb E\,N(A)=\int_A \rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g(x)$ with $\rho(x)\equiv\rho_0$ in the homogeneous case.
* **A4 (No in‑cell reinforcement; conditional Papangelou intensity).** Conditional on the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the past light‑cone $\mathcal J^-(A)$, the **Papangelou intensity** inside $A$ is almost surely $\rho(x)$ (i.e., the conditional birth rate in an infinitesimal 4‑volume does **not** depend on the configuration already present **inside** that 4‑volume).
* **A5 (Local finiteness).** $N(K)<\infty$ almost surely for any bounded spacetime $K\subset M$.

Under A1–A5, counts in disjoint sets are independent Poisson and the sampler equals (in law) a Poisson sprinkling (homogeneous if $\rho\equiv \rho_0$, inhomogeneous otherwise). The induced order by the manifold causal relation is a **locally finite partial order**; Poisson statistics give faithful embedding.

## 1) Relativistic Gas: standing hypotheses already proved in your files

I recall (without re‑deriving) the structural facts you established and use them as inputs:

* **(H‑minAct)** *Minimum‑action / large‑deviation derivation with a Poisson jump cumulant.*
  The **jump** part of the Hamilton–Jacobi functional is exactly the convex **Poisson** cumulant

  $$
  \mathcal H_{\rm jump}[\Phi;f]
  =\tfrac14\!\iint V(y)\,f(y)\,Q_\delta(x|y)
  \Big(e^{\tfrac12(\Phi(x)-\Phi(y))}-1-\tfrac12(\Phi(x)-\Phi(y))\Big)\,dx\,dy,
  $$

  and the **optimal** (zero‑cost) jump intensity (cloning kernel) is

  $$
  \mathcal Q^\star_t(dx \!\leftarrow\! dy) = V(y)\,f(t,y)\,Q_\delta(dx|y)\,e^{\frac12(\Phi(x)-\Phi(y))}.
  $$

  This identifies the jump mechanism as **Poissonian** (the log‑Laplace transform is the hallmark $e^{z}-1-z$).
  *Source:* your minimum‑action derivation (forward/adjoint pair, Doob structure; the explicit $e^z-1-z$ form).

* **(H‑Doob/QSD)** *Doob normalization, quasi‑stationary regime.*
  The normalized evolution is the Doob/replicator form $\partial_t p = L^\dagger p + (V-\bar V)p$. In the quasi‑stationary state (QSD), $\bar V$ subtracts the uniform “vacuum” piece. The QSD on $M$ exists and is mixing (forward FK/Doob theory in your notes).

* **(H‑Locality/IG)** *Finite‑range IG kernel & geometric isotropy.*
  The IG kernel $Q_\delta(\cdot|\cdot)$ has finite range or fast decay in the embedding and is built from metric (coordinate‑free) quantities; there is no dependence on arbitrary labels.

* **(H‑CST)** *CST construction.*
  The CST is the genealogical DAG of birth/kill events. Its order is induced by the manifold causal order and is acyclic by construction.

I use only these.

## 2) Proof that RG satisfies A1–A5

### Lemma 1 (Locality / Bell causality — A1)

**Claim.** The probability of producing an episode in a spacetime region $A$ is unaffected by algorithmic updates restricted to a region $B$ that is spacelike separated from $A$.

**Reason.**
(i) The **transport/noise** part of the SDE lives on $\mathcal U M$ and is localized in time; it depends on local geometry (Sasaki lift) and Brownian increments along paths, hence respects the manifold causal structure.
(ii) The **cloning (jump)** intensity at $(t,x)$ depends on the **previsible** pair $(f(t,\cdot),\Phi(t,\cdot))$ through $V(y)f(t,y)Q_\delta(x|y)\,e^{(\Phi(x)-\Phi(y))/2}$. With **finite range** (or fast decay) of $Q_\delta$ in the embedding and with the algorithm’s update rule depending only on **past** information (filtration of the process), spacelike updates in $B$ do not alter the intensity at $A$. There is no superluminal dependence in the birth intensity.
∎

---

### Lemma 2 (Covariance / label invariance — A2)

**Claim.** The sampling law is label‑invariant and isometry‑invariant (in distribution).

**Reason.**
(i) **Label‑invariance:** the algorithm’s rules never refer to the names/labels of episodes—only to their marks and distances through $Q_\delta$ and the geometric SDE; relabelings leave all laws unchanged.
(ii) **Isometry‑invariance:** the coefficients of the SDE and the kernel $Q_\delta$ are defined from the metric (Sasaki/Levi‑Civita data); under an isometry $\psi:(M,g)\!\to\!(M,g)$, push‑forward of initial data maps solutions to solutions with the same law. Hence the **law** of the point process of births is invariant under $\mathrm{Isom}(M,g)$.
∎

---

### Lemma 3 (Poisson structure of births; Papangelou intensity — A4)

**Claim.** Conditional on the past filtration $\mathcal F_{t^-}$ (equivalently on $\mathcal J^-(A)$ for a small region $A$ at time $t$), the **Laplace functional** of new births inside $A$ matches that of a **Poisson random measure** with intensity measure

$$
\Lambda_t(dx\,dt) \;=\; \lambda_t(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g(x)\,dt,
\qquad \lambda_t(x)=\int V(y)\,f(t,y)\,Q_\delta(x|y)\,e^{\frac12(\Phi(x)-\Phi(y))}\,dy.
$$

In particular, the **Papangelou intensity** in an infinitesimal 4‑volume equals $\lambda_t(x)$ and does not depend on the configuration **inside** that 4‑volume.

**Reason.**
The jump part of your minimum‑action functional is exactly the **Poisson cumulant** $e^{z}-1-z$. This is the log‑Laplace transform of a **Poisson random measure** with compensator $\Lambda_t$. Thus, conditional on $\mathcal F_{t^-}$, births in disjoint microcells are **independent**, each with Poisson law of mean $\int \lambda_t\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g\,dt$. The compensator depends on the **previsible** fields $(f,\Phi)$ but not on the intra‑cell configuration; hence the Papangelou intensity in a microcell is **deterministic given $\mathcal F_{t^-}$** and equals $\lambda_t(x)$.
∎

> **Remark.** This is exactly the standard representation of jump SDEs with Poisson random measures: the presence of the $(e^z-1-z)$ cumulant in your Hamilton–Jacobi derivation is the “smoking gun” that the underlying randomness is Poissonian at the level of births.

---

### Lemma 4 (Intensity proportional to volume — A3)

**Claim (Homogeneous/QSD case).** In the QSD regime with **uniform** alive density and stationary $(f,\Phi)$, the compensator $\lambda_t(x)$ is a **constant** $\rho_0$ (independent of $x,t$) and

$$
\mathbb E\,N(A)\;=\;\rho_0\,\mathrm{Vol}_g(A).
$$

**Claim (Inhomogeneous case).** If $f$ (or $\Phi$) is slowly varying, the intensity is $\rho(x)$ and $\mathbb E\,N(A)=\int_A \rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g(x)$.

**Reason.**
In the QSD, the Doob normalization removes the uniform “vacuum” piece $\bar V$, and stationarity forces $(f,\Phi)$ to be time‑independent. If the QSD is **uniform** (the regime used in your holography section), convolution against a finite‑range **isotropic** $Q_\delta$ yields a **constant** $\lambda(x)\equiv\rho_0$. In a curved or weakly inhomogeneous setting, $\lambda(x)=\rho(x)$ with $\rho$ determined by the local stationary solution. Either way, the **intensity measure** is $\Lambda(A)=\int_A \rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g(x)$.
∎

---

### Lemma 5 (Local finiteness — A5)

**Claim.** For any bounded $K\subset M$, $N(K)<\infty$ almost surely.

**Reason.**
By Lemma 4, $\mathbb E\,N(K)=\int_K \rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g(x) < \infty$. For a Poisson process with finite mean on $K$, counts are almost surely finite. Even before using full Poisson machinery, the compensated jump intensity is locally integrable (finite range and bounded $f$ in QSD), so the total number of jumps in $K$ is almost surely finite.
∎

---

### Proposition 1 (RG births form a (in)homogeneous Poisson point process)

Combining Lemmas 1–5, the birth process (episodes) generated by the RG is (i) **Poisson** with compensator $\Lambda(dx\,dt)=\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g(x)\,dt$ (homogeneous if $\rho\equiv \rho_0$), and (ii) **invariant in distribution** under isometries and relabelings.

*Proof.* A1 and A2 give causality and invariance. Lemma 3 identifies the **Poisson** nature conditionally on the past (deterministic Papangelou intensity). Lemma 4 identifies the **intensity** proportional to volume. Lemma 5 gives local finiteness. The standard characterization of Poisson processes (void probabilities/Laplace functionals/ Papangelou intensity) completes the proof. ∎

---

## 3) The induced causal set and faithful embedding

Let $C$ be the set of episodes “sprinkled” by Proposition 1, and define the order $x\prec y \iff x\in J^{-}(y)$ (manifold causal order). Then:

* **Partial order.** Reflexive/antisymmetric/transitive follow from the manifold causal structure; the genealogical construction forbids cycles.
* **Local finiteness.** For any Alexandrov interval $I(p,q)$, $\mathbb E\,\#(C\cap I(p,q))=\int_{I(p,q)}\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g(x)<\infty$ ⇒ finite almost surely.
* **Faithful embedding.** For any region $A$, the count $N(A)$ is Poisson with mean $\int_A\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g$. This is exactly the definition used in causal‑set theory for a faithful embedding (in the homogeneous case $\rho=\rho_0$, inhomogeneous otherwise). Therefore $(C,\prec)$ is a **causal set** faithfully embedded in $(M,g)$.

∎

---

## 4) Role of the Information Graph (IG)

The proof above uses only the **birth process** and **manifold causal order**. The **IG** is an auxiliary structure for dynamics/observables. As long as the IG edges/weights are **order‑invariant** functionals (e.g., of interval cardinalities, link relation) and accept **nonlocality** (unbounded valency), the **sampling law** and the **causal order** are **unchanged**; no CST axiom is violated. (Finite‑valency “nearest‑neighbor” truncations may be used for numerics but must not be made fundamental.)

---

## 5) What if $\rho$ is not uniform?

Nothing essential changes. The same derivation yields an **inhomogeneous Poisson** sprinkling with intensity $\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g$. The induced poset remains a valid causal set; “faithfulness” is now with respect to $\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g$. All dimension/topology/curvature estimators from causal‑set theory apply locally.

---

## 6) Summary of logical chain (one paragraph)

Your **minimum‑action** derivation fixes the **jump law** to be **Poissonian** (the $e^z\!-\!1\!-\!z$ cumulant); **locality** (finite‑range IG), **label invariance**, and **geometric covariance** ensure **causality** and **isometry invariance**; **Doob‑normalized QSD** fixes a **stationary** compensator $\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g$; hence episode births in disjoint spacetime microcells are **independent Poisson** with mean $\int\rho(x)\,d\mathrm{Vol}_g$, giving an (in)homogeneous **Poisson sprinkling**. The induced order is the manifold causal order, producing a **locally finite causal set** with a **faithful embedding**. Therefore, the **Relativistic Gas** complies with all conditions A1–A5 of a valid causal‑set sampling algorithm.

---

## Appendix: “minimal hypotheses” you actually used (for reviewers)

* Finite‑range (or fast‑decay) IG kernel in the embedding;
* Minimum‑action jump cumulant is $e^z-1-z$ (Poisson);
* Doob normalization to QSD (stationarity, vacuum subtraction);
* Geometric (metric‑built) coefficients ⇒ isometry invariance;
* Existence of bounded $f$ (alive density) on compact windows ⇒ local integrability of intensity.

These are exactly the objects and results you have already established in your internal notes (minimum‑action derivation; FK/Doob QSD; CST/IG locality).
