*fragile series — formal style (definition–theorem–proof)*

:::{admonition} 🎯 What is QCD and Why Does it Matter?
:class: important
**Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** is the fundamental theory of the **strong nuclear force** - the force that binds quarks into protons and neutrons, and holds atomic nuclei together. Think of it as the "glue" of matter at the smallest scales.

- **Quarks** are elementary particles that come in three "colors" (red, green, blue - not actual colors, but a quantum property)
- **Gluons** are force carriers that mediate interactions between quarks
- The theory is based on **SU(3) gauge symmetry** - a mathematical structure that describes how colors transform
- QCD exhibits **confinement**: quarks are never found alone in nature, only in color-neutral combinations

This document shows how to formulate QCD on a discrete fractal structure, proving it converges to the standard continuous theory!
:::

> **Purpose.** We formulate **non‑Abelian SU(3) gauge theory (QCD)** on the *fractal set* $\mathcal F=T\cup G$ (Causal Spacetime Tree $T$ + Information Graph $G$) generated by the relativistic gas. We define:
> (i) a **directed edge gauge bundle** $U_{e\to e'}\in \mathrm{SU}(3)$;
> (ii) a **canonical cycle basis** (using the CST as a spanning tree) for **Wilson loops**;
> (iii) a **gauge‑invariant Wilson action** on irregular loops with weights ensuring continuum consistency;
> (iv) a **color‑covariant Dirac operator** for quarks;
> (v) strong‑coupling confining behavior on the graph and **continuum convergence** to Yang–Mills + Dirac QCD.
> We provide proofs of **gauge invariance, existence, and convergence** under the standard manifoldlike/regularity hypotheses of the framework.

## 1. Discrete substrates and the SU(3) bundle

:::{admonition} 💡 The Big Picture
:class: note
We're building QCD on a **discrete graph structure** rather than continuous spacetime. Think of it like constructing a bridge:
- The **episodes** are the steel beams (discrete elements)
- The **CST** provides causal connections (vertical supports)
- The **IG** adds interaction links (horizontal cross-bracing)
- The **SU(3) gauge fields** live on the connections between beams

This discrete approach naturally regularizes quantum field theory while preserving gauge symmetry!
:::

### 1.1 Episodes, CST, IG (recap)

Episodes $e\in\mathcal E$ are worldline segments (birth–death) produced by the relativistic gas. The **CST** $T=(\mathcal E,\to)$ links an episode to the episode whose death/birth *caused* its birth (clone or replacement). The **IG** $G=(\mathcal E,\sim)$ connects temporally overlapping/interactive episodes. We write the **augmented 1‑skeleton of oriented edges**

$$
\mathcal E^{\Rightarrow}=\{\,e\to e'\text{ (CST)}\,\}\;\cup\;\{\,\overrightarrow{e\,e'}\text{ (an orientation of each IG edge)}\,\}.
$$

### 1.2 SU(3) link variables and gauge transformations

:::{admonition} 🔄 Understanding Gauge Fields
:class: hint
**Gauge fields** are like "instructions for parallel transport" of color charge:
- Imagine painting a quark red at one point in spacetime
- To compare it with a quark at another point, you need transport instructions
- The **link variable** $U_{e\to e'} \in \mathrm{SU}(3)$ tells you how colors rotate during transport
- Different observers might use different color conventions (gauge freedom)
- Physics must be independent of these conventions (gauge invariance)

Think of it like GPS coordinates: different coordinate systems (gauges) describe the same physical location!
:::

:::{prf:definition} SU(3) bundle on the graph
:label: def-su3-bundle-qcd
:nonumber:

Assign to each oriented edge $a=e\to e'\in\mathcal E^{\Rightarrow}$ a **link variable** $U_a\in \mathrm{SU}(3)$. A **gauge transformation** is a map $g:\mathcal E\to \mathrm{SU}(3)$ acting by

$$
\boxed{\;U_{e\to e'}\;\mapsto\; g(e)\,U_{e\to e'}\,g(e')^\dagger\;, \qquad \psi(e)\mapsto g(e)\psi(e)\;}
$$

for quark color spinors $\psi(e)$ in the fundamental representation.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Path‑ordered transport and holonomy
:label: def-path-transport-qcd
:nonumber:

For an oriented path $\pi=e_0\to e_1\to\cdots\to e_k$, define the parallel transport

$$
\mathcal U(\pi):=U_{e_{k-1}\to e_k}\cdots U_{e_0\to e_1}\in \mathrm{SU}(3).
$$

For a closed loop $C$, the **Wilson loop** is $W(C)=\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal U(C)$, independent of the starting node.
:::

:::{admonition} 🎨 Wilson Loop Intuition
:class: tip
**Wilson loops** measure the "total color rotation" around a closed path:
- Start with a quark of a specific color
- Transport it around a closed loop using the gauge field instructions
- Compare final color with initial color
- The trace gives a gauge-invariant measure of this rotation

**Physical significance**: Wilson loops detect **confined flux tubes** between quarks. A large Wilson loop with area law decay $W(C) \sim e^{-\sigma A}$ signals confinement - the energy cost grows with the area, making it impossible to separate quarks!
:::

### 1.3 Canonical cycle basis from CST + IG

:::{admonition} 🌳 Tree + Extra Edges = All Loops
:class: note
The clever trick here is using the **CST as a spanning tree**:
- A tree has no loops (it's acyclic)
- Each IG edge added to the tree creates exactly one fundamental loop
- These fundamental loops form a **basis** - any loop can be built from them

It's like a city's subway system: the main lines (CST) form a tree, and each cross-connection (IG edge) creates one new circuit. All possible routes are combinations of these basic circuits!
:::

Let $T$ be viewed as a **spanning tree** (acyclic). For each oriented IG edge $\overrightarrow{u\,v}$, define the unique **fundamental cycle**

$$
\boxed{\;C(\overrightarrow{u\,v})\;:=\; \overrightarrow{u\,v}\;\circ\; P_T(v,u)\;}
$$

where $P_T(v,u)$ is the unique directed path in $T$ from $v$ back to $u$.

:::{prf:proposition} Cycle basis
:label: prop-cycle-basis-qcd
:nonumber:

The set $\mathcal C_{\mathrm{fund}}=\{C(\overrightarrow{u\,v}):\overrightarrow{u\,v}\text{ is an IG edge orientation}\}$ is a cycle basis for the 1‑skeleton; any cycle is a $\mathbb Z$‑linear combination of these.
:::
:::{prf:proof}
:label: proof-cycle-basis-qcd

In any connected graph, a spanning tree $T$ together with one non‑tree edge generates exactly one fundamental cycle; the family over all non‑tree edges forms a basis of the cycle space. Here the non‑tree edges are the IG edges.
:::

**Geometric weight.** Using the faithful embedding and local frames, attach to each fundamental cycle $C$ a **small surface bivector** $\Sigma^{\mu\nu}(C)$ (e.g. minimal area spanning $C$ in the embedding) and area $A(C)=\|\Sigma(C)\|$.

---

## 2. Wilson action on irregular cycles

:::{admonition} 🔗 From Loops to Forces
:class: important
The **Wilson action** turns loop measurements into dynamics:
- Small loops measure the local field strength (like electromagnetic field)
- The action sums over all fundamental loops with appropriate weights
- Minimizing the action determines the gauge field configuration
- This discrete action converges to the continuous Yang-Mills action!

Think of it as springs: each loop is a spring, and the system finds the configuration that minimizes total spring energy.
:::

### 2.1 Gauge‑invariant action

:::{prf:definition} Irregular Wilson action
:label: def-wilson-action-qcd
:nonumber:

Fix a local normalization scale $\varepsilon$ and weights $w_\varepsilon(C)>0$. Define the gauge action

$$
\boxed{\;S_g^{(\varepsilon)}[U]\;=\;\frac{\beta_\varepsilon}{2N_c}\sum_{C\in\mathcal C_{\mathrm{fund}}}\;w_\varepsilon(C)\,\Big(1-\frac{1}{N_c}\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal U(C)\Big)\;}
$$

with $N_c=3$ and $\beta_\varepsilon=2N_c/g_\varepsilon^2$.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Gauge invariance
:label: thm-gauge-invariance-qcd
:nonumber:

$S_g^{(\varepsilon)}[U]$ is invariant under $U_{e\to e'}\mapsto g(e)U_{e\to e'}g(e')^\dagger$.
:::
:::{prf:proof}
:label: proof-gauge-invariance-qcd

Each $\mathcal U(C)$ transforms by conjugation with the group element at the basepoint; $\mathrm{Tr}$ is conjugacy‑invariant. Weights and the constant term are gauge‑blind.
:::

### 2.2 Continuum consistency by small‑loop expansion

:::{admonition} 🔬 Zooming In: Small Loops Reveal Field Strength
:class: hint
For tiny loops, the Wilson loop encodes the **field strength tensor** $F_{\mu\nu}$:
- As loops shrink, $\mathcal U(C) \approx I + ig F_{\mu\nu} \Sigma^{\mu\nu} + ...$
- The $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the "curvature" of the gauge connection
- It measures how much color rotation occurs in an infinitesimal area

Analogy: Like measuring Earth's curvature by walking a small triangle and checking if angles sum to more than 180°. The excess angle reveals local curvature!
:::

Assume **manifoldlike scaling**: cycles shrink ($A(C)=O(\varepsilon^2)$), local frames/tetrads exist, and the color connection 1‑form $A_\mu(x)$ is $C^2$. For small loops,

$$
\mathcal U(C)\;=\;\exp\!\big(i g_\varepsilon F_{\mu\nu}(x_C)\,\Sigma^{\mu\nu}(C) + O(\varepsilon^3)\big),
$$

so

$$
\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal U(C)\;=\;N_c-\tfrac{g_\varepsilon^2}{2}\,\mathrm{Tr}\big[F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}\big]\Sigma^{\mu\nu}(C)\Sigma^{\rho\sigma}(C)+O(\varepsilon^6).
$$

:::{prf:theorem} Consistency with Yang–Mills
:label: thm-yang-mills-consistency-qcd
:nonumber:

There exist weights $w_\varepsilon(C)$ and a normalization $\beta_\varepsilon$ determined by local geometric calibration (episode density/volume estimates) such that

$$
\boxed{\;S_g^{(\varepsilon)}[U]\;=\;\frac{1}{4 g^2}\int \mathrm{Tr}\,F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\,\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x\;+\;O(\varepsilon^2)\;}
$$

as $\varepsilon\to 0$.
:::
:::{prf:proof} (sketch)
:label: proof-yang-mills-consistency-qcd

Partition the domain into local neighborhoods where cycles are approximately planar; choose $w_\varepsilon(C)\propto A(C)^{-2}$ times the local 4‑volume element $\Delta V$ estimated from episode counts. Then each term contributes $\sim \tfrac{\beta_\varepsilon}{2N_c} \cdot \tfrac{g_\varepsilon^2}{2}\,\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)\,A(C)^2 \cdot A(C)^{-2}\Delta V$. Calibrate $\beta_\varepsilon$ so $\tfrac{\beta_\varepsilon g_\varepsilon^2}{4N_c}\to \tfrac{1}{4g^2}$. Summing over cycles yields a Riemann sum of $\mathrm{Tr}F^2$ against $\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x$ up to $O(\varepsilon^2)$ discretization error (bounded curvature/regularity).
:::

### 2.3 Strong‑coupling confinement on the graph

:::{admonition} ⚡ The Confinement Mechanism
:class: attention
**Confinement** is QCD's most dramatic feature - why we never see isolated quarks!

The **area law** $\langle W(C)\rangle \sim e^{-\sigma A(C)}$ means:
- Energy cost grows with separation distance (linear potential)
- Like stretching a rubber band that never breaks
- Instead, it's energetically cheaper to create new quark-antiquark pairs
- This is why pulling quarks apart creates new hadrons, not free quarks!

At strong coupling (large $g$), the discrete lattice naturally exhibits this confinement.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Area law at strong coupling
:label: thm-area-law-qcd
:nonumber:

For sufficiently small $\beta_\varepsilon$ (strong coupling), the expectation of a large Wilson loop obeys an **area law**

$$
\langle W(C)\rangle \;\le\; K\,e^{-\sigma\,A(C)}
$$

with constants $K,\sigma>0$ depending on local degree bounds and weights, implying **confinement**.
:::
:::{prf:proof} (sketch)
:label: proof-area-law-qcd

Use character expansion of $\exp(-S_g^{(\varepsilon)})$ and the cycle basis: each loop insertion must be tiled by fundamental cycles. As on a lattice, the lowest‑order (strong‑coupling) contribution fills the minimal surface with plaquette‑like cycles, producing a factor that decays exponentially with the number of tiles $\propto A(C)$. Local finiteness and bounded degree ensure uniform constants.
:::

## 3. Quarks: color‑covariant Dirac operator and propagators

:::{admonition} 🌈 Quarks: Particles with Color and Spin
:class: note
Quarks are special - they carry both:
1. **Spin** (like all fermions) - described by Dirac spinors
2. **Color charge** - the SU(3) quantum number

The quark field $\Psi$ has both indices: $\Psi = (\text{spinor}) \otimes (\text{color vector})$

When quarks hop between episodes, they experience:
- **Spin transport** from curved spacetime (gravitational effect)
- **Color transport** from gauge fields (strong force effect)

These combine into the full transport operator $\mathbb{U} = \mathcal{U}^{\text{spin}} \otimes U^{\text{color}}$!
:::

### 3.1 Spin & color transport

Let $\mathcal U^{\mathrm{spin}}_{e\to e'}\in \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb C)$ be the spin transport from local tetrads (as in the fermion layer). Define the **combined transport** on an edge $e\to e'$:

$$
\mathbb U_{e\to e'}\;=\;\mathcal U^{\mathrm{spin}}_{e\to e'}\otimes U_{e\to e'} \;\;\in\; \mathrm{Spin}(1,3)\otimes \mathrm{SU}(3).
$$

### 3.2 Discrete color‑covariant Dirac operator

:::{admonition} 🔀 The Quark Hopping Operator
:class: tip
The discrete Dirac operator describes how quarks "hop" on the graph:
- First term: CST neighbors (causal propagation)
- Second term: IG neighbors (spatial interactions)
- Mass term: resistance to propagation
- Color matrices: how color rotates during hops

**Gauge covariance** means: if you change color conventions (gauge transformation), the physics remains unchanged - the operator transforms consistently!
:::

:::{prf:definition} Quark operator on the graph
:label: def-quark-operator-qcd
:nonumber:

For a quark field $\Psi:\mathcal E\to\mathbb C^{4}\otimes\mathbb C^{3}$ define

$$
\boxed{\;
(D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}\Psi)(e)=\frac{i}{\tau_e}\sum_{e'\in \mathrm{nb}_T(e)} \mathbf n_{e\to e'}\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol\gamma \,\mathbb U_{e\to e'}\Psi(e')\;+\;\frac{i}{\tau_e}\sum_{\overrightarrow{e\,e''}\in \mathrm{nb}_{\mathrm{IG}}(e)} \eta_{e\to e''}\,\mathbb U_{e\to e''}\Psi(e'')\;-\;m\,\Psi(e)\;}
$$

with $\eta_{e\to e''}$ interaction phases on oriented IG edges. This is gauge‑covariant: $D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}$ intertwines the local action $\Psi(e)\mapsto g(e)\Psi(e)$.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Consistency
:label: thm-quark-consistency-qcd
:nonumber:

For smooth test spinors with color, under manifoldlike scaling and bounded couplings,

$$
(D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}\Psi)|_{\mathcal E}\;\to\;(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu + i\gamma^\mu A_\mu^a T^a - m)\Psi
$$

in $\ell^2(\mathcal E)$, where $A_\mu$ is the continuum SU(3) connection and $T^a$ the generators.
:::
:::{prf:proof}
:label: proof-quark-consistency-qcd

Same expansion as in the fermion case for the spin/tetrad part; the color transport inserts $U_{e\to e'}=I+igA_\mu\Delta x^\mu+O(\varepsilon^2)$, giving the gauge term $i\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi$. Errors vanish with $\varepsilon\to 0$.
:::

### 3.3 Quark propagator and determinant

:::{admonition} 📊 The Fermion Determinant
:class: important
When you "integrate out" quarks quantum mechanically, you get the **fermion determinant**:
- It encodes all possible quark loops (virtual quark-antiquark pairs)
- Modifies the effective gauge field dynamics
- Creates an attractive force between quarks at short distances
- Essential for asymptotic freedom (weakness at high energy)

Think of it as "quantum foam": virtual quark pairs constantly pop in and out of existence, screening the color charge and affecting gauge field dynamics!
:::

Define the **quark propagator** $S_F^{\mathrm{QCD}}=(D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N})^{-1}$ (retarded/Feynman by boundary choice). Integrating out quarks yields the **fermion determinant** $\det D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}$, entering the effective gauge measure

$$
d\mu_\varepsilon(U)\;\propto\; e^{-S_g^{(\varepsilon)}[U]}\,\prod_f \det D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}(m_f;U)\; \prod_{a\in\mathcal E^{\Rightarrow}} dU_a.
$$

:::{prf:theorem} Gauge invariance and existence
:label: thm-gauge-invariance-existence-qcd
:nonumber:

$\det D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}$ is gauge‑invariant; for finite graphs and sufficiently small steps, $D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}$ is invertible almost surely, so $S_F^{\mathrm{QCD}}$ exists.
:::
:::{prf:proof}
:label: proof-gauge-invariance-existence-qcd

Gauge invariance follows from intertwining. Invertibility: Gershgorin bounds as in the fermionic layer ensure the mass/diagonal dominates small off‑diagonal contributions.
:::

---

## 4. Continuum limit: Yang–Mills + Dirac QCD

:::{admonition} 🎯 The Grand Convergence
:class: note
This section proves our discrete QCD becomes continuous QCD as the lattice becomes fine:
- **Gauge sector**: Wilson action → Yang-Mills action $\frac{1}{4g^2} \int \text{Tr} F^2$
- **Matter sector**: Discrete Dirac → Continuous Dirac equation
- **Key insight**: The irregular fractal structure doesn't break anything!

It's like digital photos: as pixels get smaller, the discrete image becomes indistinguishable from continuous reality. Our fractal QCD "pixels" converge to smooth quantum fields!
:::

Assume the framework's **faithful embedding, local finiteness, bounded geometry**, and **standardization/aggregation continuity** hold; also assume **stability** (uniform bound on inverses over test spaces).

:::{prf:theorem} Convergence of gauge sector
:label: thm-gauge-convergence-qcd
:nonumber:

With weights $w_\varepsilon(C)$, normalization $\beta_\varepsilon$ chosen as in Section 2.2, the discrete Wilson action satisfies

$$
S_g^{(\varepsilon)}[U]\;\xrightarrow{\varepsilon\to 0}\;\frac{1}{4g^2}\int \mathrm{Tr}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\,\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x.
$$
:::
:::{prf:proof}
:label: proof-gauge-convergence-qcd

Small‑loop expansion and Riemann‑sum argument; the cycle basis avoids double counting and the local calibration uses episode counts to produce the correct 4‑volume element.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Convergence of quark sector
:label: thm-quark-convergence-qcd
:nonumber:

For smooth compactly supported test spinors $\phi,\psi$,

$$
\langle \phi, (D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N})^{-1}\psi\rangle\;\xrightarrow{\varepsilon\to 0,\,N\to\infty}\;\langle \phi, (i\slashed{\nabla}+i\slashed{A}-m)^{-1}\psi\rangle,
$$

i.e. the discrete quark propagator converges to the continuum QCD propagator.
:::
:::{prf:proof}
:label: proof-quark-convergence-qcd

Consistency + stability (discrete Lax equivalence) yield convergence of resolvents; path‑sum representation converges to the worldline/path‑integral form.
:::

---

## 5. Observables and algorithms

:::{admonition} 📏 What We Can Measure
:class: hint
**Physical observables** must be gauge-invariant (independent of color conventions):

- **Wilson loops**: Probe confinement via area/perimeter law
- **Polyakov loops**: Detect deconfinement phase transitions
- **Quark potential**: $V(r)$ from rectangular Wilson loops
- **Hadron masses**: From correlation functions of color-neutral operators

These are the "photographs" we can take of the quantum chromodynamic world!
:::

### 5.1 Observables (gauge‑invariant)

- **Wilson loop** $W(C)=\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal U(C)$ (string tension $\sigma$ from area law).
- **Polyakov loop** along oriented time cycles (deconfinement order parameter in thermal runs).
- **Quark–antiquark potential** from large rectangular cycles (Coulomb → linear).
- **Hadron correlators** via gauge‑averaged color‑singlet bilinears using $S_F^{\mathrm{QCD}}$.

### 5.2 Update/estimation algorithms (irregular heatbath)

:::{admonition} 🎲 Monte Carlo on the Graph
:class: tip
**Heatbath/Metropolis** algorithms sample gauge configurations:
1. Pick a link $U_{e\to e'}$
2. Calculate "staples" (neighboring loop contributions)
3. Update link to reduce action (with thermal fluctuations)
4. Repeat until equilibrium

It's like annealing metal: random thermal motions help the system find low-energy configurations. The "temperature" is $1/\beta$ - lower temperature means less fluctuation, stronger ordering.
:::

- **Link updates:** Randomly select an oriented edge $a$, compute its "staple" (product of neighboring loop contributions) from $\mathcal C_{\mathrm{fund}}$, update $U_a\in \mathrm{SU}(3)$ via heatbath/Metropolis w.r.t. the local action.
- **Quark sector:** Compute $S_F^{\mathrm{QCD}}$ via Krylov solvers on $D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N}$; use determinant factorizations or pseudo‑fermions for $\det D$.
- **Strong‑coupling/weak‑coupling checks:** Measure $\langle W(C)\rangle$ vs $A(C)$; verify area/Perimeter crossover.

---

## 6. Remarks and extensions

:::{admonition} 🚀 Advanced Topics
:class: seealso
This framework opens doors to many extensions:
- **Curved spacetime QCD**: Gravity is built-in via tetrad transport!
- **Renormalization**: Match physics at different scales $\varepsilon$
- **Finite temperature**: Polyakov loops probe deconfinement
- **Real-time dynamics**: CST structure enables causal evolution

The fractal framework isn't just a curiosity - it's a powerful computational and conceptual tool for quantum chromodynamics!
:::

1. **Choice of orientation for IG edges** does not affect gauge invariants (traces of loops), only conventions of path ordering.
2. **Gravitational coupling** is native: spin transport is from tetrads reconstructed from the swarm; thus QCD on curved backgrounds is immediate.
3. **Renormalization** can be implemented by running at several $\varepsilon$ (episode densities) and matching observables (e.g. string tension) across scales.
4. **Ghosts/gauge fixing** are optional in Wilson formulation; they enter only if one pursues perturbation theory on $\widetilde{\mathcal F}$.

### Appendix A — Geometric calibration of weights $w_\varepsilon(C)$

:::{admonition} ⚖️ Getting the Weights Right
:class: note
The weights $w_\varepsilon(C)$ ensure each loop contributes correctly to the continuum limit:
- Small loops need larger weights (they represent smaller areas)
- Weight $\propto A(C)^{-2}$ cancels the $A(C)^2$ from field strength
- Local volume element from episode density

It's like numerical integration: each sample point needs the right weight to approximate the integral accurately!
:::

Let $\{\mathcal N_x\}$ be a cover by small neighborhoods; on $\mathcal N_x$, estimate $\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x$ from episode counts and proper‑time chain statistics, and estimate $\Sigma^{\mu\nu}(C)$ from the embedded geometry. Define

$$
w_\varepsilon(C)=\frac{\Delta V(\mathcal N_{x_C})}{\sum_{C'\subset\mathcal N_{x_C}} A(C')^2}\;A(C)^{-2},
$$

so that $\sum_{C\subset\mathcal N_{x_C}} w_\varepsilon(C)\approx \Delta V(\mathcal N_{x_C})$. This yields the Riemann‑sum property used in Section 2.2.

### Appendix B — Strong‑coupling character expansion on the cycle basis

:::{admonition} 🎭 Character Expansion Magic
:class: hint
The **character expansion** is a powerful technique:
- Expand exponentials in terms of SU(3) group characters
- Only "tiled" surfaces survive group integration
- Each tile contributes a suppression factor
- Result: area law emerges naturally!

Think of tiling a floor: the cost is proportional to the area, not the perimeter. This mathematical tiling translates directly to physical confinement!
:::

Expand $\exp\big(\tfrac{\beta_\varepsilon}{2N_c}\mathrm{Re\,Tr}\,\mathcal U(C)\big)$ in SU(3) characters. Only tilings of the minimal surface by fundamental cycles survive the group integrals, giving $\langle W(C)\rangle\sim \kappa^{\#\mathrm{tiles}}$ with $\#\mathrm{tiles}\propto A(C)$. Bounded degrees imply a uniform lower bound on tile density, giving the area law with constants $K,\sigma$.

### Appendix C — Worldline representation of the quark propagator

:::{admonition} 🛤️ All Paths Lead to Propagation
:class: tip
The **worldline representation** expresses the propagator as a sum over paths:
- Each path from $q$ to $p$ contributes
- Weight includes spin rotation, color transport, and fermionic sign
- In the continuum limit → Feynman path integral

It's the quantum version of "all roads lead to Rome" - particles explore all possible paths, with quantum interference determining the final amplitude!
:::

On finite graphs,

$$
(D^{\mathrm{QCD}}_{\varepsilon,N})^{-1}(p,q)=\sum_{\pi:q\to p}\Big[\prod_{(e\to e')\in\pi}\frac{i}{\tau_e}\,\mathbf n_{e\to e'}\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol\gamma \,\mathcal U^{\mathrm{spin}}_{e\to e'}\,U_{e\to e'}\Big]\cdot(-1)^{N_{\text{ex}}(\pi)}
$$

with exchange counter from the fermionic layer. The color factor is the path‑ordered SU(3) transport; the limit reproduces the standard worldline/path‑integral representation.
