# IG–CST Relationship in the Relativistic Gas Algorithm

## Discrete Definitions: IG Entropy and CST Boundary Area

### Information Graph (IG) Cut Capacity

In the Fragile framework, each **episode** (node) represents a walker's state at an event (e.g. cloning or selection)¹. Episodes form a weighted, undirected **Information Graph (IG)** via symmetric interaction edges generated by local selection/matching rules². Given a region of episodes $A\subset \mathcal{E}$ (e.g. walkers in a chosen boundary set), an **IG cut** $\Gamma$ is any set of IG edges whose removal disconnects the episodes in $A$ from those in the complement $A^c$³. The **capacity** of a cut is the total weight of its edges:

$$\mathrm{Cap}(\Gamma) := \sum_{e\in \Gamma} w_e\,.$$

Among all such cuts, the **minimal information cut** $\Gamma_{\min}(A)$ is one attaining the smallest total weight⁴. The **IG entropy** of region $A$ (our entanglement entropy proxy) is then defined as the capacity of this minimal cut⁵:

$$S_\varepsilon(A) \;:=\; \mathrm{Cap}\big(\Gamma_{\min}(A)\big)\,.$$

Here $\varepsilon$ denotes the discrete resolution scale (e.g. smoothing radius or time step)⁶. This $S_\varepsilon(A)$ depends only on the IG structure (episodes and interaction edges) and represents the minimum "informational" weight of links severed to isolate $A$⁷.

### Causal Spacetime (CST) Boundary Area

Episodes are also linked by ancestry in a directed acyclic graph (the **CST**) reflecting parent–offspring (cause–effect) relations in the walker swarm¹. This CST is a locally finite causal set, meaning episodes carry a partial order $\prec$ (earlier $\to$ later) and can be embedded in a manifold-like spacetime⁸. A set $S\subset\mathcal{E}$ of episodes is an **antichain** if no two episodes in $S$ are causally related (none precedes another)⁸. An antichain $S$ **separates** region $A$ from the deep past if every causal path that ends in $A$ intersects $S$ —intuitively, $S$ is a "layer" of episodes that blocks all causal trajectories into $A$⁸.

Among all separating antichains, there is at least one with minimal size. We denote by $\gamma_A$ the **minimal CST separating antichain** for $A$, defined by minimizing the number of episodes $|S|$ in the separating set⁹:

$$\gamma_A \;\in\;\arg\min{\;|S|:\; S \text{ is an antichain that separates }A\;}\,.$$

The **CST boundary area** of region $A$ is then identified (up to calibration) with the cardinality of this minimal separating set. In discrete terms, the area is simply the number of episodes in $\gamma_A$ (each episode being a "unit" of area in the boundary). For consistency with the emergent manifold, a fixed conversion factor $a_0$ (episodes per unit area) is introduced¹⁰. Thus one defines:

$$\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{CST}}(\gamma_A) \;:=\; a_0\,|\gamma_A|\,,$$

where $a_0>0$ calibrates node counts to physical area¹¹. In practice $a_0$ is chosen so that $a_0|\gamma|$ approximates the continuum area $\int_{\Sigma}\rho_{\mathrm{CST}}(x)\,d\Sigma$ for a smooth surface $\Sigma$ through the embedding, with $\rho_{\mathrm{CST}}(x)$ the episode density¹².

### Independent Nature of Definitions

It is crucial to note that $S_\varepsilon(A)$ (IG entropy) and $\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{CST}}(\gamma_A)$ (boundary area) are defined on entirely different data structures. The IG cut is computed from interaction edges and their weights, whereas the CST area comes from counting episodes in a causal slice¹³. They share no common constructional ingredients¹³. Therefore, any relationship between these quantities is **not by definition** but must arise from the algorithm's dynamics – a nontrivial duality that we will derive rigorously.

## Minimal IG Cut vs. Minimal CST Surface (General Case)

### Do they coincide?

In general, the minimal IG cut $\Gamma_{\min}(A)$ need not coincide with the minimal CST surface $\gamma_A$. The two optimize different criteria: $\gamma_A$ minimizes the number of boundary episodes, while $\Gamma_{\min}(A)$ minimizes the total IG edge weight crossing the boundary. If every episode contributed the same amount of IG connection weight, then the smallest cut (by weight) would indeed use the fewest episodes. However, in a heterogeneous swarm, episodes vary in how strongly they connect to outside regions. A wider surface (more episodes) that passes through weakly connected areas can carry less total IG weight than a narrow surface (fewer episodes) through strongly connected areas. Thus, the IG minimal cut generally follows the **path of least informational resistance**, not necessarily the path of least episodes.

### Discrete Relationship

To make this precise, consider any candidate separating antichain $S$ (not necessarily minimal in size). Removing all IG edges that cross $S$ will certainly disconnect $A$ from $A^c$ – any IG path out of $A$ must traverse some episode in $S$, by virtue of $S$ intercepting all causal chains out of $A$. Let $\Gamma(S)$ denote the set of all IG edges that have one endpoint in $S$ and one endpoint in $A^c$ (i.e. edges crossing the cut defined by $S$). $\Gamma(S)$ is a valid cut in the IG sense, whose capacity is the total weight of edges crossing $S$:

$$\mathrm{Cap}(\Gamma(S)) \;=\; \sum_{\,i\in S}\;\sum_{\;j\notin S\,} w_{ij}\,.$$

Here $w_{ij}\ge0$ is the weight of the IG edge between episode $i$ and $j$ (zero if no direct edge). This sum can be rewritten as $\sum_{i\in S} W_i$, where $W_i := \sum_{j\notin S}w_{ij}$ is the total IG weight emanating from episode $i$ to the outside of $S$. In words, $W_i$ is the **information flux** through node $i$ (the weight of all "outsider" connections of $i$).

The minimal IG cut capacity is then obtained by minimizing this sum over all separating antichains $S$:

$$S_\varepsilon(A) \;=\; \min_{S:\,S\text{ separates }A}~\sum_{i\in S} W_i\,.$$

This is the rigorous discrete relationship between IG entropy and CST boundary: **the entropy is the minimum total IG weight through some separating set of episodes**. Generally, the minimizer $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^* := \arg\min_S\sum_{i\in S}W_i$ will not be the smallest antichain $\gamma_A$ (unless the $W_i$ are uniform). Instead, $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ may contain more episodes than $\gamma_A$ if that yields a smaller total weight. Conversely, if the IG weights per episode are biased such that a smaller set carries equally low total weight, then $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ could coincide with $\gamma_A$. But without special symmetry, $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ and $\gamma_A$ generally differ.

### Interpreting $W_i$ (Swarm Observables)

The flux $W_i=\sum_{j\notin S}w_{ij}$ through a given episode depends on local swarm properties – it is an observable derived from the algorithm's dynamics. Each IG edge weight $w_{ij}$ is determined by the interaction rules (e.g. how walkers clone or share information). By the framework's design, interactions are local: the expected weight of an edge between two small neighborhoods around positions $x$ and $y$ depends on their spatial proximity via a kernel $K_\varepsilon(x,y)$¹⁴, and edges have finite-range or rapidly decaying influence with distance¹⁵.

Moreover, in a steady-state swarm, episodes have a spatial density $\rho(x)$ (episodes per volume) and pair-density $\Pi^{(2)}(x,y)$ that influence how many edges form between regions¹⁶. Roughly speaking, an episode $i$ in a dense or highly interactive region will have a larger $W_i$ (many or strong connections), whereas one in a sparse or quiescent region has a smaller $W_i$.

For a given candidate surface $S$, we can define the **average cross-connection per node** $\bar{d}(S)$ and **average edge weight** $\bar{w}(S)$ on that surface:

• $\displaystyle \bar{d}(S) := \frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{i\in S} (\#\text{ of edges from }i\text{ to }A^c)$. This is the mean number of crossing IG edges per boundary episode (edge count flux).

• $\displaystyle \bar{w}(S) := \frac{\sum_{i\in S}\sum_{j\notin S} w_{ij}}{\sum_{i\in S}(\#\text{ edges from }i\text{ to }A^c)}$. This is the mean weight per crossing edge on $S$.

Then the total capacity through $S$ factors as:

$$\mathrm{Cap}(\Gamma(S)) \;=\; |S| \;\bar{d}(S)\;\bar{w}(S)\,.$$

The minimal cut seeks to minimize this product. The CST minimal surface $\gamma_A$ instead minimizes $|S|$ alone. Unless $\bar{d}(S)$ and $\bar{w}(S)$ are essentially constant for all plausible surfaces, the minimizers will differ. In effect, the IG cut problem assigns a variable **"area density"** to different parts of the boundary based on interaction flux, whereas the CST problem assigns unit weight to each episode. The true minimal entropy surface $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ is the one that optimally balances these factors: it might include extra episodes (increasing $|S|$) if that greatly reduces the per-node flux $\bar{d}\bar{w}$, or vice versa.

### Conclusion (General Case)

In full generality (no symmetry assumptions), the minimal IG cut $\Gamma_{\min}(A)$ and minimal CST antichain $\gamma_A$ do not coincide. Rather, $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ will be a (generally different) separating antichain for which the weighted surface area $\sum_{i\in S}W_i$ is minimal. The IG entropy $S_\varepsilon(A)$ equals the CST size of $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ weighted by the average IG flux per episode on that surface. Symbolically, if $|S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*| = N^*$ and its average flux per node is $F^* = \bar{d}\bar{w}$ on that surface, then:

$$S_\varepsilon(A) \;=\; N^* \,F^* \,,$$

where $N^*$ may exceed $|\gamma_A|$ if it achieves a lower product $N^*F^*$. Only in special cases (discussed next) do we have $F^*$ constant, making $N^*$ minimal as well.

## General IG–CST Functional Relationship

To express the relationship more formally, it is useful to imagine a continuum limit or ensemble average where stochastic fluctuations smooth out. In a stationary regime (unique Quasi-Stationary Distribution) with detailed balance, the swarm yields a smooth episode density $\rho(x)$ and an interaction kernel $K_\varepsilon(x,y)$ as above¹⁷. In that case one can associate to any macroscopic region $A$ a **nonlocal perimeter functional** $\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon(A)$ equal to the expected IG cut capacity through $A$'s boundary¹⁸:

$$\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon(A) \;:=\; \iint K_\varepsilon(x,y)\,\rho(x)\,\rho(y)\,dx\,dy\,,$$

so that $\mathbb{E}[S_\varepsilon(A)] = \inf_{B\sim A}\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon(B)$¹⁹. Intuitively, $K_\varepsilon(x,y)\rho(x)\rho(y)\,dx\,dy$ represents the expected IG weight between an infinitesimal patch $dx$ on one side of a trial surface and a patch $dy$ on the other side²⁰. The minimal cut in the IG corresponds to the surface $B$ that minimizes this nonlocal perimeter.

As the interaction range $\varepsilon$ shrinks (more localized interactions), this converges to a **local surface integral**. In fact, under mild assumptions (e.g. isotropic kernel and smooth densities), one can show²¹:

$$\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon(A) \;\xrightarrow[]{\varepsilon\to0}\; c_0 \int \rho(x)^2\,d\Sigma(x)\,,$$

i.e. the IG cut cost approaches an area integral with density $c_0\,\rho(x)^2$ on the surface²². Here $d\Sigma$ is the area element on the continuum surface and $c_0>0$ a constant from the kernel's normalization²³. Importantly, the integrand involves $\rho(x)^2$: **the square of the episode density**. This arises because the probability of cross-edges scales with the product of densities on each side (since edges form in proportion to pairs of episodes in adjacent volumes)²⁴.

By contrast, the CST area of the same surface in the continuum embedding is proportional to $\int_{\partial A}\rho_{\mathrm{CST}}(x)\,d\Sigma(x)$ (since $\rho_{\mathrm{CST}}$ episodes per unit area times area gives expected episode count). In a stationary standardized frame, the calibration is chosen so that $\rho_{\mathrm{CST}}(x)$ equals $\rho(x)$ (the physical mass density is proportional to the episode density $q(x)$ up to $h$-transform factors²⁵). Thus, heuristically:

• **IG cut cost (continuum)**: $\sim c_0\int_{\partial A} \rho(x)^2\,d\Sigma(x)$.
• **CST area cost (continuum)**: $\sim a_0\int_{\partial A} \rho(x)\,d\Sigma(x)$ (with $a_0$ calibrating units)¹².

These are generally different functionals of the surface. The IG prefers surfaces that minimize $\rho^2$-weighted area, whereas the CST "area" is $\rho$-weighted (or effectively unweighted if $\rho$ is treated as part of volume calibration). A surface that is optimal for one functional need not be optimal for the other, unless those weight distributions coincide. In discrete terms, this means the set $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ of episodes that minimizes $\sum_{i\in S}W_i$ may not be the smallest $|S|$. Instead, $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ tends to go through regions of lower episode density (lower $\rho$) to exploit the quadratic reduction in edge weight ($\rho^2$) even if that means including more nodes. Meanwhile, $\gamma_A$ would cut straight across, minimizing the count $\int \rho$ without squaring. Only if $\rho$ is uniform (or $W_i$ homogeneous) do these two objectives align.

We can formally relate the two measures. For any given separating surface $S$, define a **surface entropy density** $\alpha(i) := W_i$ for each episode $i\in S$ (so $\alpha(i)$ has units of weight per node). Then $S_\varepsilon(A) = \sum_{i\in S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*}\alpha(i)$. If we project this onto the manifold, one can think of $\alpha(x)$ as a spatial field encoding how much IG weight flows through a unit area at location $x$ on the surface. The CST area of (the continuum analog of) $S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*$ is $a_0\int_{S_{\mathrm{IG}}^*}\rho(x)\,d\Sigma(x)$. Thus, one could write the **general IG–CST relationship** as:

$$S_\varepsilon(A) \;=\; \int_{\partial A_{IG}^*} \alpha(x)\;d(\mathrm{Area}_{CST})\,,$$

where $\partial A_{IG}^*$ denotes the continuum surface corresponding to the optimal IG cut and $d(\mathrm{Area}_{CST}) = a_0\,\rho(x)\,d\Sigma(x)$ is the CST area element¹². Here $\alpha(x)$ varies with $x$, encapsulating the swarm observables (local episode density and interaction strength) that affect the IG cut. In particular, comparing to the above formulas, one identifies $\alpha(x) = \frac{c_0\,\rho(x)^2}{a_0\,\rho(x)} = \frac{c_0\,\rho(x)}{a_0}$ if $\rho_{\mathrm{CST}}\equiv \rho$ locally. In that ideal case, $\alpha(x)$ is constant over the surface (since $c_0$ and $a_0$ are fixed), recovering the simple proportionality. In general, $\alpha(x)$ is a function (the local IG/CST density ratio), so the entropy is an integral of a variable density over the surface. **This is the rigorous statement of how IG entropy and CST geometry relate: the IG cut entropy equals the CST area, weighted pointwise by the local IG edge flux per episode.**

## Special Cases: Detailed Balance and Uniform QSD

Under certain symmetric conditions, the above relationship simplifies dramatically:

### Detailed Balance (Reversibility)

In the stationary regime of the relativistic gas, after a Doob $h$-transform, the effective dynamics are conservative and reversible²⁶. The invariant episode density is $q(x)\propto h(x)^2$, and the two-point intensity factorizes as $\Pi^{(2)}(x,y)\approx \rho(x)\rho(y)$ on small scales¹⁶. This implies that IG edge weights have a symmetric distribution tied to the product of local densities. The result is that the mean cut capacity can be evaluated by the $\rho(x)\rho(y)$ integral above²⁰. Detailed balance by itself ensures the IG weight functional is well-behaved, but not necessarily uniform.

### Uniform QSD

If, moreover, the stationary density is **uniform** (in the appropriate frame), i.e. $\rho(x)\equiv \rho_0$ is constant across the region of interest (and $\rho_{\mathrm{CST}}$ is uniformly $\rho_0$ as well), then $\rho^2(x)$ is constant. In this case the IG cut functional becomes proportional to the plain surface area. Specifically, $c_0\,\rho_0^2\int_{\partial A}d\Sigma = c_0\rho_0^2\,\mathrm{Area}(\partial A)$²⁸. Meanwhile $a_0|\gamma| = \rho_0\,\mathrm{Area}(\partial A)$ by calibration²⁹. Thus, up to the constant factor,

$$c_0\,\rho_0^2\,\mathrm{Area}(\partial A) \;\propto\; a_0\,|\gamma_A|\,.$$

The two surface measures coincide (differing only by the scalar $\frac{c_0\rho_0^2}{a_0}$), and they select the same minimizers³⁰. In the continuum limit, the optimal IG cut $\partial A_{\min}$ aligns exactly with the minimal CST surface, and we obtain the **area–entropy proportionality law**:

$$S(A) = \alpha\,\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{CST}}(\gamma_A)\,,$$

with $\displaystyle \alpha = \frac{1}{a_0}\,c_0\,\rho_0^2$ a constant³². At the discrete level, this means the minimal IG cut concentrates on the same set of episodes as the minimal CST antichain (up to small fluctuations)³³. All the IG flux observables condense into the single constant $\alpha$. Equivalently, one can write $\alpha = \bar{d}\,\bar{w}$³⁴, the product of the mean number of cross-boundary edges per boundary episode and the mean weight per such edge in stationarity. These averages are the same for all boundary episodes when the state is uniform, yielding a universal proportionality factor.

## Summary

In the **general discrete case**, the IG entropy of a region $A$ is given by a weighted count of boundary episodes, weighting each episode by its outward information flux. The minimal IG cut typically traces out a different set of episodes than the minimal CST cut, except in special circumstances. Under detailed balance and especially uniform QSD conditions, the weights $W_i$ become proportional to episode count, causing the IG cut to align with the CST minimal surface. In that regime the relationship simplifies to an area law $S_\varepsilon(A)\approx \alpha_\varepsilon\,\mathrm{Area}_{CST}(\gamma_A)$³⁵, approaching $S(A)=\alpha\,\mathrm{Area}(\gamma_A)$ in the continuum limit³⁶. All assumptions and approximations (local interaction kernel, stationarity, manifold-like scaling of the CST, uniform density) are then satisfied, and the IG–CST duality becomes an exact proportionality³⁵. In the absence of those assumptions, the corrected, rigorous statement is that **informational entropy equals a "weighted" geometric area**, with the weight determined by local swarm observables (episode density and interaction statistics).

This refined IG/CST duality is faithful to the discrete relativistic gas algorithm and makes clear that any entropy–area law holds only under specified equilibrium conditions, rather than as an unconditioned identity.

## References

The above derivation consolidates definitions from the Relativistic Gas framework and the holographic duality analysis³⁸. It refines the conditional result in `holographic_duality.md`³⁹ by accounting for spatially varying densities and explicitly linking $S_\varepsilon(A)$ to $\bar{d}$ and $\bar{w}$ (cross-edge number and weight) at the boundary³⁴. The outcome is a fully discrete, assumption-transparent formula for the IG–CST relationship:

• $S_\varepsilon(A) = \min_{S \text{ separates }A}\sum_{i\in S}W_i$, with $W_i$ determined by local interaction rules (**general case**).

• $S_\varepsilon(A) = \alpha_\varepsilon\,a_0|\gamma_A| + o(|\gamma_A|)$, with $\alpha_\varepsilon = c_\varepsilon \rho^2/a_0$, under locality, stationarity, and uniform density assumptions (**detailed balance case**)⁴¹.
