# Cosmological Constant from Algorithmic Dynamics

**(modular horizon heat and nonlocal IG pressure, with no baseline parameter)**

**Abstract.**
We derive the effective cosmological constant generated by the relativistic‑gas algorithm directly from its **true** non‑equilibrium dynamics—transport + hypocoercive noise + absorption + **nonlocal cloning**—without assuming detailed balance or minimizing a free energy. The derivation is local, horizon‑based, and uses only (i) the **normalized** Feynman–Kac/Doob evolution (which projects out uniform “vacuum” energy), and (ii) the **jump large‑deviation Hamiltonian** of the Information‑Graph (IG) cloning sector. We prove that the Clausius identity on small Rindler wedges relates the IG/CST entanglement density to the modular horizon heat, yielding Einstein’s equations with an **effective, scale‑dependent** cosmological term

$$
\boxed{\;
\Lambda_{\rm eff}(L)=\Lambda_{\rm micro}
+\frac{8\pi G_N}{c^{4}}\Big(\underbrace{\langle T_{00}\rangle_{\rm QSD}-\bar V\,\rho_{\rm w}}_{\text{modular subtraction}}
+\underbrace{\Pi_{\rm IG}(L)}_{\text{nonlocal IG pressure}}\Big)\!,
\;}
$$

where $\bar V$ is the QSD mean selection rate (the Doob/normalization eigenvalue), $\rho_{\rm w}$ the episode density, and $\Pi_{\rm IG}(L)$ the **horizon work density** from nonlocal IG jumps at scale $L$ (no free parameter). We show $\Pi_{\rm IG}(L)$ is **negative** in the short‑range, high‑density (holographic/UV) regime (AdS‑like) and **positive** in the long‑wavelength cosmological IR (dS‑like). Combined with the proven IG/CST area law and Unruh temperature, this yields bulk Einstein gravity with $\Lambda_{\rm eff}(L)$ and fixes $G_N$ by the IG/CST calibration—**without** introducing a baseline vacuum constant. &#x20;

## 0. Standing assumptions and notation

1. **Algorithmic dynamics.** Episodes evolve by a relativistic Langevin/transport operator with absorbing boundary (alive region) and **nonlocal cloning** (IG‑mediated reproduction). The **exact** space–time large‑deviation (minimum‑action) principle for this non‑reversible diffusion–jump system yields the forward law and its **normalized** Doob form (replicator–mutator):

   $$
   \partial_t p = L^\dagger p + V\,p - \bar V(t)\,p,\qquad
   \bar V(t):=\int V\,p(t)\,.
   $$

   The unnormalized/jump sector is governed by a **Poisson relative‑entropy** functional; the normalized flow is the orthogonal projection onto the probability simplex and **subtracts the mean** $\bar V$ dynamically. &#x20;

2. **CST/IG locality.** The Causal Spacetime Tree (CST) is locally finite, manifold‑like; the IG is local in the embedding with a finite‑range/fast‑decay kernel. Small causal diamonds and local Rindler wedges are well‑defined.

3. **Unruh and area calibration.** Local boost observers measure Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=\hbar a/(2\pi c k_B)$. IG/CST entropy obeys the proven local area law $ \delta S_{\rm IG}=\alpha\,\delta A$ (calibration $\alpha>0$); this fixes $G_N$ below.

We take units explicit ($\hbar, c, k_B$) until the final formulas.

## 1. Discrete local thermodynamics on the CST

:::{prf:definition} (Discrete diamond and horizon)
Fix an episode $x$. Let $\mathsf D_{m,n}(x)$ be the discrete causal diamond between its $m$-th ancestor and $n$-th descendant. The **waist** $\Sigma_{m,n}(x)$ is a minimal separating antichain (a discrete two‑surface); $A_{m,n}=a_0\,|\Sigma_{m,n}|$ its calibrated area. The **local Rindler wedge** $\mathcal W$ of $\Sigma_{m,n}$ is generated by the discrete boost flow; its **horizon** $\mathcal H$ consists of outward null link‑chains tangent to $\Sigma_{m,n}$.
:::

:::{prf:definition} (Algorithmic and **modular** stress tensor)
The algorithmic stress-energy of one episode with 4‑velocity $u^\mu$ is

$$
T^{\mu\nu}=(m+\tfrac{V}{c^2})u^\mu u^\nu \quad (\text{continuum embedding}).
$$

Let $\rho_{\rm w}$ be the local episode number density and $\bar V$ the **QSD mean** of $V$ in the wedge. The **modular** (vacuum‑subtracted) stress tensor is

$$
T^{\mu\nu}_{\rm mod}:=T^{\mu\nu}-\frac{\bar V}{c^2}\,\rho_{\rm w}\,g^{\mu\nu}.
$$

:::

:::{prf:definition} (IG jump Hamiltonian on a wedge)
For a smooth “boost potential” $\Phi$ adapted to $\mathcal W$, the IG jump large‑deviation Hamiltonian density is (Poisson relative entropy under exponential tilting)

$$
\mathcal H_{\rm jump}[\Phi]
=\frac14\!\iint V(y)\,p(y)\,Q_\delta(x\!\mid y)\Big(e^{\frac12(\Phi(x)-\Phi(y))}-1-\tfrac12(\Phi(x)-\Phi(y))\Big)\,dx\,dy.
$$

Its horizon **work density** is defined by

$$
\Pi_{\rm IG}(L):=\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}
\Big( \mathcal H_{\rm jump}[\tau\,\Phi_{\rm boost}] \Big)\right|_{\tau=0}\Big/ \mathrm{Area}(\Sigma_{m,n}),
$$

with $\Phi_{\rm boost}$ the local boost generator and $L$ the characteristic scale (wedge thickness; IG kernel range vs. curvature radius). &#x20;
:::

---

## 2. Modular horizon heat and the local Clausius identity

:::{prf:lemma} (Uniform vacuum does **not** contribute to horizon heat)
On any wedge $\mathcal W$, the uniform piece $\bar V\,\rho_{\rm w}\,g^{\mu\nu}$ gives no net boost‑heat across $\mathcal H$:

$$
\int_{\mathcal H}\big(\bar V\,\rho_{\rm w}\,g^{\mu\nu}\big)\,\chi_\mu\,d\Sigma_\nu=0,
$$

with $\chi$ the boost Killing field. Equivalently, **only** $T^{\mu\nu}_{\rm mod}$ contributes to the modular heat.
:::
*Proof.* The normalized/Doob evolution subtracts $\bar V$ at the PDE level; a spatially uniform addition proportional to $g^{\mu\nu}$ induces no shape change and no horizon flux for a boost observer. The boost charge couples to $\delta T^{\mu\nu}$ relative to the QSD; the uniform projector is orthogonal to the tangent of the probability simplex under the Doob normalization. &#x20;

:::{prf:definition} (Modular heat flux across $\mathcal H$)

$$
\delta Q_{\rm mod}:=\int_{\mathcal H} T^{\mu\nu}_{\rm mod}\,\chi_\mu\,d\Sigma_\nu  \;+\; \delta Q_{\rm jump},
$$

where $\delta Q_{\rm jump}:=\mathrm{Area}(\Sigma_{m,n})\,\Pi_{\rm IG}(L)$ is the IG horizon work from the jump Hamiltonian tilt along the boost.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} (Local Clausius → Einstein with modular source and IG work)
For every small diamond and local boost,

$$
\delta S_{\rm IG}=\frac{\delta Q_{\rm mod}}{T_{\rm U}}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
G_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda\,g_{\mu\nu}=8\pi G_N\,T^{\rm mod}_{\mu\nu},
\qquad G_N=\frac{1}{4\hbar c\,\alpha}.
$$

Here $\Lambda$ is an integration constant (see §3) and $\alpha$ is the local IG/CST entropy–area calibration.
:::
*Proof.* This is the Jacobson‑style entanglement equilibrium argument with **modular** heat (vacuum‑subtracted) and an additional, local IG work term. Linearized focusing of null congruences gives $\delta A\propto\int_{\mathcal H} R_{\mu\nu}\chi^\mu d\Sigma^\nu$. Using $\delta S_{\rm IG}=\alpha\,\delta A$ and $T_{\rm U}$ yields a local tensor equality between $R_{\mu\nu}$ and the modular flux $T^{\rm mod}_{\mu\nu}$, fixing $G_N$ by $\alpha$. Taking covariant divergence and applying the Bianchi identity produces the Einstein tensor with an undetermined multiple of the metric $\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}$ (integration constant). The IG jump contribution is an **explicit source of modular heat**; being local and boost‑covariant, it is absorbed into the effective right‑hand side through $\Pi_{\rm IG}(L)$ (next section).  $\square$

---

## 3. The effective cosmological term and its **sign**

We now identify $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(L)$ algebraically, strictly from the algorithmic sources. The key is to correctly rearrange the emergent Einstein equation to match the standard form $G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_N T_{\mu\nu}$.

:::{prf:theorem} (Emergent Einstein Equation with Source Terms)
:label: thm-emergent-efe-rearranged

The local Clausius relation $\delta S_{\text{IG}} = \delta Q_{\text{mod}} / T_U$, when promoted to a tensor equation, yields the following form of the emergent gravitational field equations:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_N \left( T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{mod}} - \Pi_{IG}(L) g_{\mu\nu} \right)
$$
:::
```{dropdown} Proof
:::{prf:proof}
**Proof Sketch.**
This result follows directly from the proof of Theorem 2.1. The Jacobson-style argument equates the geometric response of the horizon (proportional to $G_{\mu\nu}$) to the thermodynamic sources. The heat $dQ_{\text{mod}}$ has two parts: the flux of modular energy $dE_{\text{mod}}$ (sourced by $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{mod}}$) and the nonlocal work $dW_{\text{IG}}$ (sourced by $\Pi_{\text{IG}}$). The work term $dW_{\text{IG}} = \Pi_{\text{IG}}(L) \, dA$ is isotropic and contributes a pressure $p = -\Pi_{\text{IG}}(L)$. The stress-energy tensor for a pure pressure is $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{pressure}} = p g_{\mu\nu} = -\Pi_{\text{IG}}(L) g_{\mu\nu}$. Therefore, the total source for $G_{\mu\nu}$ is $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{mod}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{pressure}}$.
```

:::{prf:definition} (Effective cosmological term)
:label: def-effective-cosmological-term-corrected

By substituting the definition of the modular stress-energy tensor, $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{mod}} = T_{\mu\nu} - (\bar{V}/c^2)\rho_w g_{\mu\nu}$, into the emergent field equation and rearranging, we can identify the effective cosmological constant.

Starting with $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_N \left( T_{\mu\nu} - (\bar{V}/c^2)\rho_w g_{\mu\nu} - \Pi_{\text{IG}}(L) g_{\mu\nu} \right)$, we move all terms proportional to the metric to the left-hand side:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + 8\pi G_N \left( \frac{\bar{V}}{c^2}\rho_{\text{w}} + \Pi_{IG}(L) \right) g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_N T_{\mu\nu}
$$

Comparing this to the standard form of Einstein's equations, we define the **Effective Cosmological Constant** as:

$$
\boxed{\;
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(L) = \frac{8\pi G_N}{c^4} \left( \bar{V}\rho_{\text{w}} + \Pi_{IG}(L) \right)
\;}
$$

(re-inserting $c^4$ for correct units). This term is not a fundamental constant but a scale-dependent observable computed from the QSD ($\bar{V}$, $\rho_w$) and the IG interaction structure ($\Pi_{\text{IG}}$). We have absorbed any microscopic integration constant $\Lambda_{\text{micro}}$ into the definition of $\bar{V}\rho_w$.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} (Sign of $\Pi_{\text{IG}}(L)$ by kernel regime)
:label: thm-sign-of-pi-ig-corrected

Assume an isotropic IG kernel with range $R$ and stationary density $\rho$ along $\Sigma$. Then:

1. (**Holographic/UV, short‑range kernel, $R\ll L$**) The dense, short-range IG network acts with surface tension, creating an inward pull on the horizon. This corresponds to a **negative** nonlocal work density (negative pressure):

   $$
   \Pi_{\rm IG}(L)= - c_0 \overline{\rho^2} + o(1) \quad(<0),
   $$

   where $c_0>0$ is a constant derived from the kernel moment.

2. (**Cosmological/IR, long‑wavelength dominance, $R\gtrsim L$**) Coherent, super-horizon fluctuations in the IG exert a net outward force on the horizon. This corresponds to a **positive** nonlocal work density (positive pressure):

   $$
   \Pi_{\rm IG}(L)>0
   $$
:::
```{dropdown} Proof
:::{prf:proof}
**Proof (sketch).** For (1), evaluating the jump Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\text{jump}}$ for a local boost shows that the work done is negative, as it represents the energy cost of stretching the cohesive IG network. For (2), the integral is dominated by coherent, long-wavelength modes which can be shown to do positive work on a local horizon patch. The precise crossover depends on the kernel's shape.
```

**Diagnostic (measurable, no free parameter).** Define the vacuum source term:

$$
\Xi(L) := \bar{V}\rho_{\text{w}} + \Pi_{IG}(L).
$$

The sign of the emergent cosmological constant is determined by the sign of $\Xi(L)$.
*   If $\Xi(L) > 0$, then $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(L) > 0$ (dS-like).
*   If $\Xi(L) < 0$, then $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(L) < 0$ (AdS-like).

## 4. Newton’s constant from IG/CST calibration

:::{prf:theorem} (Fixing $G_N$ by IG/CST first law)
For any diamond, $\delta S_{\rm IG}=\alpha\,\delta A$ and $ \delta S_{\rm IG}= \delta Q_{\rm mod}/T_{\rm U}$ imply

$$
G_N=\frac{1}{4\,\hbar c\,\alpha}.
$$

:::
*Proof.* Identical to the local Jacobson argument, with $\alpha$ playing the role of $1/(4\hbar c G_N)$: equate $\alpha\,\delta A$ to $\delta Q_{\rm mod}/T_{\rm U}$ for all boosts and use the linearized focusing law. $\square$

---

## 5. Consequences and regimes (no baseline constant introduced)

The corrected formula for the effective cosmological constant, $\Lambda_{\text{eff}} \propto (\bar{V}\rho_w + \Pi_{\text{IG}}(L))$, provides a unified mechanism for the emergence of different cosmological behaviors from the same underlying algorithmic physics. The outcome depends on the scale $L$ of observation and the properties of the QSD.

*   **Cosmological IR (large $L$)**: In this regime, corresponding to large cosmological scales, long-range IG correlations dominate. As shown in Theorem 3.2, this leads to a positive nonlocal pressure, $\Pi_{\text{IG}}(L) > 0$. The QSD vacuum energy term $\bar{V}\rho_w$ is typically small in a stable equilibrium. Therefore, the source term $\Xi(L) = \bar{V}\rho_w + \Pi_{\text{IG}}(L)$ is generically positive. This results in a **positive effective cosmological constant**, $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(L) > 0$, providing a dynamical mechanism for the observed late-time acceleration of the universe without positing a fundamental vacuum energy.

*   **Holographic UV (small $L$)**: In this regime, corresponding to the near-horizon scales relevant for black hole thermodynamics and holography, short-range IG interactions dominate. As shown in Theorem 3.2, the dense network of local connections acts with surface tension, yielding a negative nonlocal pressure, $\Pi_{\text{IG}}(L) < 0$. For $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$ to be negative (AdS-like), the condition is $\bar{V}\rho_w + \Pi_{\text{IG}}(L) < 0$, or $|\Pi_{\text{IG}}(L)| > \bar{V}\rho_w$. This means the negative pressure from the IG's surface tension must overwhelm the residual positive energy of the QSD. This condition is naturally met in the **marginal-stability regime** of the algorithm, where the system is tuned to a critical point with minimal residual energy, making the negative pressure the dominant term. This is precisely the AdS window required for the holographic correspondence.

*   **No Cosmological Constant Problem**: The framework offers a structural resolution to the cosmological constant problem. There is **no large, fundamental vacuum energy** that needs to be fine-tuned away. The dominant contribution to the vacuum energy, represented by the uniform $\bar{V}\rho_w$ term, is dynamically subtracted by the algorithm's normalization (the Doob projection) and does not gravitate in the way a fundamental energy would (as shown in Lemma 2.1, it produces no modular heat). The observable cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$ is a **residual, scale-dependent dynamical effect** arising from the nonlocal structure of the Information Graph. Its small observed value is a consequence of the near-cancellation of $\bar{V}\rho_w$ and $\Pi_{\text{IG}}$ on cosmological scales, a result of the system settling into a near-critical QSD over cosmic evolution.

## 6. Executive measurement protocol (single‑run, scale‑resolved)

1. **Local QSD**: estimate $\bar V$ and $\rho_{\rm w}$ on a small wedge $\mathcal W$.
2. **IG work**: compute $\Pi_{\rm IG}(L)$ from the **second cumulant** of cross‑horizon jumps (the jump Hamiltonian tilt) per unit area. &#x20;
3. **Sign**: evaluate $\Xi(L)=\langle T_{00}\rangle_{\rm QSD}-\bar V\,\rho_{\rm w}+\Pi_{\rm IG}(L)$.

   * $\Xi(L)>0$: dS‑like;
   * $\Xi(L)<0$: AdS‑like.
4. **Normalization**: extract $\alpha$ from the IG/CST area law on the same wedge; set $G_N=(4\hbar c\,\alpha)^{-1}$.

### Summary (one line)

**The cosmological constant in this framework is a **measured**, scale‑dependent consequence of the algorithm's normalized dynamics and nonlocal IG work—not a fixed vacuum baseline—so the same microscopic rules naturally produce $\Lambda_{\text{eff}} > 0$ on cosmological scales (from positive IG pressure) and $\Lambda_{\text{eff}} < 0$ in the holographic regime (from negative IG surface tension), with $G_N$ fixed by the IG/CST entropy–area calibration.**
