# **Chapter 8: The Fractal Set — Discrete Graph Structures from Cloning Dynamics**

**Chapter goal.** From a single run of the Euclidean Gas algorithm ([Chapter 2](02_euclidean_gas.md)) we *construct* two discrete graph structures—the **Causal Spacetime Tree (CST)** and the **Information Graph (IG)**—directly from the algorithmic log of cloning events and walker genealogy. The CST captures parent→child relationships (who cloned from whom), while the IG captures selection coupling (which walkers influenced each other's survival through the cloning mechanism). We combine these into the **Fractal Set** $\mathcal{F} := (\mathcal{E}, E_{\text{CST}} \cup E_{\text{IG}})$, providing a discrete foundation for analyzing swarm dynamics.

:::{warning}
**Scope limitations:** This chapter provides **definitions and constructions** of CST, IG, and Fractal Set based on the discrete-time Euclidean Gas. Many theoretical properties mentioned (continuum limits, spectral convergence, causal set structure) are **conjectures** that would require:
1. Rigorous analysis of the continuum limit as $N \to \infty$ and $\Delta t \to 0$
2. Proof of convergence for discrete graph Laplacians to continuum operators
3. Characterization of the limiting measure on causal structures

These extensions are **future work**. The current chapter focuses on *algorithmic construction* rather than *theoretical guarantees*.
:::

**Why "Fractal Set"?** The name reflects three key properties:
1. **Self-similarity**: The CST's branching structure exhibits statistical self-similarity under repeated cloning
2. **Dimensional richness**: Combines 0-dimensional (nodes), 1-dimensional (edges), and 2-dimensional (plaquettes) structures
3. **Algorithmic genesis**: Like fractals generated by iterative processes, $\mathcal{F}$ emerges from repeated cloning cycles

**Chapter structure.** Sections 0–2 define the CST from cloning genealogy. Sections 3–4 construct the IG and define the Fractal Set. Sections 5–7 discuss projections (preliminary). Section 9 concludes. Appendix B contains plaquette definitions.

## 0. Foundations: spacetime, episodes, and algorithmic axioms

### 0.1. The spacetime arena

:::{prf:definition} State Space Manifold
:label: def-d-state-space-manifold

The **state space** is a Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal{X}, G)$ where:
- $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$: The configuration space (positions accessible to walkers)
- $G = G(x, S)$: The metric tensor induced by the fitness landscape Hessian (see [Chapter 7](07_adaptative_gas.md))

For the Adaptive Gas, the metric tensor is:

$$
G_{\text{reg}}(x, S) = (H_{\Phi}(x, S) + \epsilon_\Sigma I)^{-1},
$$

where $H_{\Phi}$ is the regularized Hessian of the fitness potential and $\epsilon_\Sigma > 0$ ensures uniform ellipticity.

We denote:
- ${\rm dVol}_G$: The volume element induced by $G$
- $\mathcal{X}_{\text{valid}} \subset \mathcal{X}$: The valid domain where walkers remain alive
- Time parameter $t \in [0, T]$: Discrete algorithmic timesteps indexed by $t = n\Delta t$

**Standing assumption**: $\mathcal{X}$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, and the metric $G$ is uniformly elliptic (proven in [Chapter 7](07_adaptative_gas.md)).
:::

**Intuition.** The Riemannian structure ensures:
- **Information-geometric interpretation**: The metric $G$ captures curvature of the fitness landscape
- **Well-posed dynamics**: Uniform ellipticity guarantees the SDE has unique strong solutions
- **Temporal ordering**: Discrete timesteps $t = n\Delta t$ define a natural temporal order on events

These properties enable the CST to encode genealogical relationships and the temporal evolution of the walker population.

### 0.2. Walker episodes and the algorithmic log

The Euclidean Gas algorithm—detailed in [Chapter 2](02_euclidean_gas.md) and [Chapter 3](03_cloning.md)—evolves a regulated population of $N$ **walkers** via:
1. **Kinetic phase**: Langevin dynamics on position-velocity space with BAOAB integrator ([Chapter 2](02_euclidean_gas.md), Section 1.1)
2. **Measurement phase**: Compute fitness values and algorithmic distances using companion selection
3. **Cloning phase**: Clone/persist decisions based on relative fitness scores ([Chapter 3](03_cloning.md))
4. **Status update**: Walkers exiting the valid domain $\mathcal{X}_{\text{valid}}$ are marked as dead

**Notation conventions:**
- $\mathcal{E}$: Set of all episodes (total across all time)
- $E$: Same as $\mathcal{E}$ (context-dependent)
- $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$: Expectation operator
- $\mathcal{T}$: The Causal Spacetime Tree (CST) graph structure
- $\mathcal{L}(\cdot)$: Law (probability distribution) of a random object
- $\mathcal{F}_t$: Natural filtration (past history up to time $t$)

:::{prf:definition} Walker Status and Episodes
:label: def-d-walker-status-episodes

A **walker** at timestep $t$ is a tuple $(x_t, v_t, s_t)$ where:
- $x_t \in \mathcal{X}$: Position in configuration space
- $v_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$: Velocity vector
- $s_t \in \{0,1\}$: Survival status (1 = alive, 0 = dead/absorbed)

An **episode** $e$ is a maximal contiguous alive interval $[t^{\rm b}_e, t^{\rm d}_e)$ of a walker's trajectory. The episode comprises:
- **Trajectory**: $\gamma_e : [t^{\rm b}_e, t^{\rm d}_e) \to \mathcal{X}$, evolving via the Adaptive Gas dynamics ([Chapter 7](07_adaptative_gas.md)):

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  dx_t &= v_t \, dt, \\
  dv_t &= \mathbf{F}_{\text{total}}(x_t, v_t, S_t) \, dt + \Sigma_{\text{reg}}(x_t, S_t) \circ dW_t,
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  where $\mathbf{F}_{\text{total}}$ includes confining, adaptive, and viscous forces, and $\Sigma_{\text{reg}}$ is the regularized diffusion tensor based on the fitness Hessian.

- **Birth event**: $(t^{\rm b}_e, x_{t^{\rm b}_e})$, the timestep and position where $s$ transitions $0 \to 1$
- **Death event**: $(t^{\rm d}_e, x_{t^{\rm d}_e})$, the timestep and position where $s$ transitions $1 \to 0$ (due to boundary exit or cloning)
- **Episode duration**:

  $$
  \tau_e := t^{\rm d}_e - t^{\rm b}_e
  $$

  (measured in discrete timesteps $\Delta t$)

**Status transitions:**
- $0 \to 1$ (birth): Episode begins, either from initial conditions or by cloning/replacement of a dead walker
- $1 \to 0$ (death): Episode ends, either by exiting $\mathcal{X}_{\rm valid}$ or being selected for cloning (parent dies, child is born)
:::

:::{prf:definition} The Algorithmic Log and Episode Embedding
:label: def-d-algorithmic-log

The **algorithmic log** $\mathcal{L}$ is the complete record of all episodes $e \in \mathcal{E}$, storing for each $e$:
1. Unique episode identifier $\text{id}(e) \in \mathbb{N}$
2. Parent identifier $\text{parent}(e) \in \mathcal{E} \cup \{\text{root}\}$ (root if initial walker)
3. Birth timestep $t^{\rm b}_e$ and death timestep $t^{\rm d}_e$
4. Episode duration $\tau_e = t^{\rm d}_e - t^{\rm b}_e$
5. (Optionally) Trajectory sample $\{(t_i, x_i, v_i)\}_{i=1}^{K_e}$ along $\gamma_e$

The **canonical embedding** $\Phi : \mathcal{E} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{X}$ assigns to each episode a spatial mark:

$$
\Phi(e) := x_{t^{\rm d}_e} \quad \text{(death position)}.
$$

**Remark**: This choice (death position) is canonical for cloning-based algorithms. Alternative choices (birth position, trajectory-weighted centroid) yield different embeddings with distinct properties; our constructions apply to any consistent $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable embedding.

The embedding Φ(e) maps episodes to their death positions in configuration space $\mathcal{X}$, while episode duration τₑ measures the time elapsed. Cloning events create branching where a parent episode terminates and child episodes begin.
```

:::{prf:definition} Genealogy and Causal Graph Structure
:label: def-d-genealogy-causal-structure

The **parent-child relation** $e_i \to e_j$ (read "$e_j$ is a child of $e_i$") holds iff:

$$
t^{\rm b}_j = t^{\rm d}_i \quad \text{and} \quad \text{parent}(e_j) = \text{id}(e_i).
$$

**Edge multiplicity**: A single episode $e_i$ may have **multiple children** (cloning produces multiple episodes from one parent). It has **exactly one parent** (or none, if root).

The **CST edge weight** is:

$$
\omega(e_i \to e_j) := \tau_i.
$$

The **ancestry relation** $e \prec e'$ (read "$e$ is an ancestor of $e'$") is the transitive closure of $\to$:

$$
e \prec e' \iff \exists \, \text{path} \, e = e_0 \to e_1 \to \cdots \to e_k = e'.
$$
:::

:::{admonition} Key Insight: Time-reversal asymmetry
:class: tip

The genealogy relation $\to$ is **directed** and **acyclic** by construction: an episode cannot be its own ancestor because time flows forward ($t^{\rm b}_j = t^{\rm d}_i$ implies $j$ was born after $i$ died). This temporal ordering is the foundation for the CST being a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.
:::

### 0.3. Foundational axioms for the Fractal Set

We now state the **five minimal algorithmic axioms** that any valid EG implementation must satisfy for the theorems in this chapter to hold. These axioms are **verifiable properties** of the algorithm's design, not assumptions about the physical world.

:::{prf:axiom} Temporal Causality (No Future Dependence)
:label: def-ax-locality

For any timestep $t$, the cloning decisions depend only on the past history, not on future states.

**Formally**: Let $\mathcal{F}_t := \sigma(\{(s, x_s, v_s, s_s) : s \leq t, \, \text{all walkers}\})$ be the natural filtration. Then for all $t$ and walker $i$,

$$
P(\text{walker } i \text{ clones at step } t) = f(\mathcal{S}_t, \mathcal{H}_{\leq t}),
$$

where $\mathcal{S}_t$ is the current swarm state and $\mathcal{H}_{\leq t}$ is the history up to time $t$.

**Interpretation**: No future dependence—cloning decisions at timestep $t$ cannot depend on walker states at times $s > t$.

**Verification in Euclidean Gas**: The cloning probability $P_{\text{clone}}(i)$ for walker $i$ at timestep $t$ depends only on:
- The fitness values $\Phi(x_i(t))$, evaluated at current positions ([Chapter 3](03_cloning.md))
- Algorithmic distances computed from current swarm state $\mathcal{S}_t$
- Past trajectory data (all $\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable)

Since the algorithm operates synchronously at discrete timesteps, temporal causality holds by construction.
:::

:::{prf:axiom} Exchangeability and Label-Invariance
:label: def-ax-covariance

The law of the algorithmic log is invariant under:

1. **Walker permutations**: For any permutation $\pi : \{1, \ldots, N\} \to \{1, \ldots, N\}$,

   $$
   \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{S}_t) = \mathcal{L}(\pi(\mathcal{S}_t)),
   $$

   where $\pi(\mathcal{S}_t)$ relabels walkers but preserves fitness values and relative positions.

2. **Episode label permutations**: For any bijection $\sigma : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}$,

   $$
   \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}) = \mathcal{L}(\sigma(\mathcal{L})),
   $$

   where $\sigma(\mathcal{L})$ relabels episode identifiers but preserves genealogical structure.

**Interpretation**:
- (1) Walker exchangeability—this is the key property enabling mean-field limits ([Chapters 5-6](05_mean_field.md))
- (2) Episode labels (ID numbers) are arbitrary bookkeeping; the genealogical structure is label-independent

**Verification in Euclidean Gas**:
- Covariance: The kinetic SDE is written in coordinate-free form ([Chapter 4](04_convergence.md), Remark 4.2); the fitness $\Phi$ is a geometric functional (scalar under coordinate changes)
- Label-invariance: The cloning operator samples uniformly from the alive set (no preference for low/high IDs)
:::

:::{prf:axiom} Population-Regulated Stationarity
:label: def-ax-population-regulation

There exists a **quasi-stationary distribution (QSD)** $\mu$ on the space of living swarms $\Sigma_N^{\text{alive}} := \{(x_1, \ldots, x_N, s_1, \ldots, s_N) : \sum_i s_i = N\}$ such that:

1. **Conditional stationarity**: Conditioned on survival, the swarm distribution converges to $\mu$:

   $$
   \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{S}_t \mid \tau_{\text{ext}} > t) = \mu,
   $$

   where $\tau_{\text{ext}}$ is the extinction time.

2. **Previsible compensator**: The birth counting process $N(A \times [0,t])$ has a well-defined compensator $\Lambda_t(A)$ (predictable intensity):

   $$
   M_t(A) := N(A \times [0,t]) - \int_0^t \Lambda_s(A) \, ds
   $$

   is a martingale w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}_t$.

3. **Locally integrable intensity**: For compact $K \subset M$,

   $$
   \int_0^T \Lambda_t(K) \, dt < \infty \quad \text{a.s. for all } T < \infty.
   $$

**Interpretation**: The algorithm is "self-regulating"—despite individual walker deaths, the population maintains a statistical equilibrium. This is the content of the QSD convergence mechanism ([Chapter 3](03_cloning.md), Theorem 3.4).

**Verification in RG**: [Chapter 3](03_cloning.md), Section 3.3 proves that the cloning operator with fitness $\Phi(x) = -U(x)$ induces a QSD under mild conditions on $U$.
:::

:::{prf:axiom} Finite Range or Rapid Decay
:label: def-ax-finite-range

The cloning kernel $Q_\delta(x' | x)$ (probability of child born at $x'$ given parent at $x$) satisfies one of:

1. **Finite range**: $\exists R < \infty$ such that $Q_\delta(x' | x) = 0$ for $d_g(x, x') > R$, or
2. **Rapid decay**: $Q_\delta(x' | x) \leq C e^{-\alpha d_g(x, x')^\beta}$ for constants $C, \alpha, \beta > 0$,

where $d_g$ is the geodesic distance on $(M, g)$.

**Interpretation**: Children are born "near" their parents—cloning does not create arbitrarily large spatial jumps. This ensures the embedded episode events $\Phi(\mathcal{E})$ inherit the manifold's local geometry.

**Verification in RG**: [Chapter 3](03_cloning.md), Definition 3.3 specifies $Q_\delta$ as a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth $\delta$, satisfying rapid decay.
:::

:::{prf:axiom} Local Finiteness (Non-Explosion)
:label: def-ax-local-finiteness

For any compact $K \subset M$ and finite time interval $[0,T]$,

$$
\mathbb{E}\big[N(K \times [0,T])\big] < \infty,
$$

where $N(A)$ counts the number of births in spacetime region $A$.

**Interpretation**: The algorithm does not produce infinite births in finite spacetime volume—explosions are forbidden.

**Verification in Euclidean Gas**: This follows from the finite population size $N$ and bounded cloning rate. Since cloning decisions are made from a fixed pool of $N$ walkers at each timestep, the number of births in any finite time interval $[0,T]$ is bounded by $O(NT)$.
:::

:::{admonition} Axiom Roles in Construction
:class: dropdown note

The five axioms support the discrete graph constructions:

- **Axiom S1 (Locality)**: Ensures CST edges respect causal structure of spacetime
- **Axiom S2 (Covariance)**: Makes constructions independent of walker labeling
- **Axiom S3 (Population Regulation)**: Maintains bounded population for well-defined graphs
- **Axiom S4 (Finite Range)**: Ensures IG edges connect spatially proximate walkers
- **Axiom S5 (Local Finiteness)**: Prevents explosion (infinite births in finite volume)

These axioms are **sufficient for defining CST, IG, and Fractal Set** as discrete structures. Continuum limits and convergence properties remain conjectural and require further analysis.
:::

**Summary.** All constructions in this chapter—the CST, IG, Fractal Set—are **derived solely from the algorithmic log $\mathcal{L}$ and axioms (S1)–(S5)**. These provide well-defined discrete graph structures from any Euclidean Gas run.

---

## 1. Episodes and genealogy (Summary)

This section consolidates the definitions from Section 0.2 for easy reference. All notation and concepts are defined rigorously in [](#def-d-walker-status-episodes), [](#def-d-algorithmic-log), and [](#def-d-genealogy-causal-structure).

**Key objects:**
- **Walker**: $(x_t, u_t, s_t)$ with $x_t \in M$, $g(u_t, u_t) = -c^2$, $s_t \in \{0, 1\}$
- **Episode**: Maximal alive trajectory segment $\gamma_e : [t^{\rm b}_e, t^{\rm d}_e) \to M$
- **Embedding**: $\Phi : \mathcal{E} \hookrightarrow M$ via $\Phi(e) = x_{t^{\rm d}_e}$ (death event)
- **Genealogy**: $e_i \to e_j$ iff $t^{\rm b}_j = t^{\rm d}_i$ and $\text{parent}(e_j) = \text{id}(e_i)$
- **Edge weight**: $\omega(e_i \to e_j) = \tau_i$ (proper lifetime of parent)
- **Ancestry**: $e \prec e'$ iff $\exists$ path $e = e_0 \to \cdots \to e_k = e'$ (transitive closure)

:::{prf:remark} Episode Lifetime Distribution
:label: rem-episode-lifetime-distribution

The proper lifetime $\tau_e$ is a random variable. In the QSD regime (Axiom [](#def-ax-population-regulation)), its distribution is determined by:
1. **Deterministic component**: The confining potential $U(x)$ biases walkers toward low-potential regions
2. **Stochastic component**: Thermal noise $\Sigma(x) \circ dW_t$ causes random excursions
3. **Absorption boundary**: Walkers die upon exiting $\mathcal{X}_{\rm valid}$

For the Euclidean Gas with globally confining $U$ (e.g., $U(x) = \frac{1}{2}\|x - x_0\|^2$), [Chapter 5](05_mean_field.md) proves that $\mathbb{E}[\tau_e]$ is bounded uniformly in the initial condition ([Chapter 5](05_mean_field.md), Theorem 5.3). For more general $U$, the lifetime distribution depends on the local geometry of $\mathcal{X}_{\rm valid}$ and the potential gradient.

**Connection to population regulation**: The cloning operator adjusts birth rates to compensate for spatially varying death rates, maintaining a quasi-stationary population. The compensator $\Lambda_t(A)$ in Axiom [](#def-ax-population-regulation) encodes this adjustment.
:::

:::{admonition} Visualizing the Episode Structure
:class: dropdown tip

In **1+1 dimensions** (time + 1 spatial dimension), episodes appear as **trajectorys** on a spacetime diagram:

```
Time ↑
     │     ╱  ← Episode e₃ (born from e₁'s death)
     │    ╱
     │   ╱
     │  ●  ← Death of e₁, birth of e₃
     │ ╱ ╲
     │╱   ╲ ← Episode e₂ (sibling of e₃, cloned from e₁)
     ●     ╲
     │╲     ╲
     │ ╲     ●  ← Death of e₂
     │  ╲
     │   ●  ← Death of e₀, birth of e₁
     │  ╱
     │ ╱ ← Episode e₁
     │╱
     ● ← Birth of e₀ (initial walker)
     │╱ ← Episode e₀
     │
     └────────────→ Space
```

Key features:
- Each **branch point** (●) is a death event (parent) and simultaneous birth event(s) (child(ren))
- **Cloning** produces multiple children from one parent (e₂ and e₃ from e₁)
- **Proper lifetime** $\tau_i$ is the length of the trajectory $\gamma_{e_i}$ in the manifold metric
:::

**Forward reference.** The CST $\mathcal{T} = (\mathcal{E}, \to)$ is formally defined in Section 2.

## 2. The Causal Spacetime Tree (CST)

### 2.1. Definition and graph structure

:::{prf:definition} Causal Spacetime Tree (CST)
:label: def-d-cst

The **Causal Spacetime Tree** (CST) is the directed graph

$$
\mathcal{T} := (\mathcal{E}, \to, \omega),
$$

where:
- $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of episodes (nodes)
- $\to \subset \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{E}$ is the parent-child relation (edges) from [](#def-d-genealogy-causal-structure)
- $\omega : \to \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ assigns to each edge $e_i \to e_j$ the weight $\omega(e_i \to e_j) = \tau_i$

The **transitive closure** of $\to$ is the ancestry partial order $\prec$ on $\mathcal{E}$:

$$
(\mathcal{E}, \prec) \quad \text{with} \quad e \prec e' \iff \exists \, \text{directed path from } e \text{ to } e' \text{ in } \mathcal{T}.
$$
:::

:::{prf:proposition} CST is a Forest
:label: prop-cst-forest

The CST $\mathcal{T} = (\mathcal{E}, \to)$ is a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**. Moreover:
1. If all walkers originate from a single initial condition, $\mathcal{T}$ is a **tree** (connected, with one root)
2. If walkers have $k$ distinct initial ancestors, $\mathcal{T}$ is a **forest** of $k$ trees

**Proof.**
1. **Acyclicity**: Suppose for contradiction that $e \prec e'$ and $e' \prec e$. Then there exist paths $e = e_0 \to \cdots \to e_m = e'$ and $e' = e'_0 \to \cdots \to e'_n = e$. By [](#def-d-genealogy-causal-structure), each edge $e_i \to e_{i+1}$ satisfies $t^{\rm b}_{i+1} = t^{\rm d}_i > t^{\rm b}_i$ (children are born after parents die). Concatenating paths yields:

   $$
   t^{\rm b}_e < t^{\rm d}_e = t^{\rm b}_{e_1} < \cdots < t^{\rm d}_{e_m} = t^{\rm b}_{e'} < \cdots < t^{\rm d}_{e'_n} = t^{\rm b}_e,
   $$

   contradicting $t^{\rm b}_e < t^{\rm b}_e$. Thus $\mathcal{T}$ is acyclic.

2. **Tree/forest structure**: Each episode has at most one parent (by definition). Episodes without parents are roots. Acyclicity + unique parent ⇒ tree structure from each root. ∎
:::

**Edge count.**  A tree with $|\mathcal{E}|$ nodes has exactly $|\mathcal{E}| - 1$ edges. A forest with $k$ connected components has $|\mathcal{E}| - k$ edges.

### 2.3. CST faithfulness and causal set properties

:::{prf:definition} CST Discrete Causal Structure
:label: def-d-cst-causal-structure

Define the relation $\prec$ on $\mathcal{E}$ by:

$$
e \prec e' \iff t^{\rm d}_e \leq t^{\rm b}_{e'},
$$

where $\Phi(e)$ is the death location of episode $e$ in spacetime.

**Provable properties** (from finite discrete construction):

1. **Partial order**: $(\mathcal{E}, \prec)$ is a partial order (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive). The CST $\mathcal{T}$ is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

2. **Finite population**: For any run of Euclidean Gas with population size $N$ and $T$ timesteps, the total number of episodes satisfies $|\mathcal{E}| \leq NT$ (bounded by total possible cloning events).

3. **Order-preserving embedding**: By construction, parent episodes die before child episodes are born:
   $$
   e \prec e' \implies t^{\rm d}_e \leq t^{\rm b}_{e'}.
   $$
:::

:::{prf:conjecture} CST Continuum Limit Properties
:label: conj-cst-faithful-embedding

If the discrete Euclidean Gas structures converge to continuum objects as $N \to \infty$, $\Delta t \to 0$, the limiting CST may satisfy:

1. **Local finiteness**: For temporal interval $I(t_1,t_2) := [t_1, t_2] \subset M$,
   $$
   \#\{e \in \mathcal{E} : \Phi(e) \in I(p,q)\} < \infty.
   $$

2. **Volume-faithful embedding**: Episode counts may have Poisson-like scaling,
   $$
   \#\{e : \Phi(e) \in A\} \sim \rho \cdot \text{Vol}_g(A)
   $$
   for measurable regions $A \subset M$, where $\rho$ is an emergent density parameter.

**Open question**: Characterizing the limiting distribution of episodes in spacetime and proving these properties requires analysis beyond the discrete algorithmic construction.
:::

**Terminology.** Structures $(\mathcal{E}, \prec, \Phi)$ with locally finite causal order and faithful volume embedding are called **locally finite causal sets** {cite}`Bombelli1987,Surya2019`. Whether the CST realizes such a structure in the continuum limit is conjectural.

### 2.4. CST observables

:::{prf:definition} CST Observables
:label: def-d-cst-observables

From the CST $\mathcal{T} = (\mathcal{E}, \to, \omega)$, we define the following geometric observables:

1. **Proper-time estimator**: For $e, e' \in \mathcal{E}$ with $e \prec e'$, define

   $$
   \mathsf{T}(e, e') := \max_{\text{paths } \pi : e \leadsto e'} \sum_{(e_i \to e_{i+1}) \in \pi} \omega(e_i \to e_{i+1}),
   $$

   :label: eq-cst-proper-time

   where the maximum is over all directed paths from $e$ to $e'$ in $\mathcal{T}$. This estimates the **maximal proper time** along ancestral trajectorys.

2. **Volume estimator**: For measurable $R \subset M$, define

   $$
   \widehat{{\rm Vol}}(R) := \frac{1}{\rho} \cdot \#\{e : \Phi(e) \in R\},
   $$

   where $\rho$ is the QSD density. This estimates ${\rm Vol}_g(R)$ in the densification limit.

3. **Spatial slices**: A set $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{E}$ is a **spatial slice** (or **antichain**) if:

   $$
   \forall \, e, e' \in \mathcal{S}, \, e \neq e' \implies e \not\prec e' \text{ and } e' \not\prec e.
   $$

   **Maximal antichains** correspond to Cauchy surfaces in the continuum limit.
:::

**Remark on proper-time estimator notation.** In [](#eq-cst-proper-time), we write $\mathsf{T}(e, e')$ for episode-to-episode proper time. This should not be confused with $T^{\mu\nu}$ (stress-energy tensor, Section 5). Context disambiguates.

### 2.5. Worked Example: CST Construction from Algorithmic Log

:::{prf:example} CST Construction in 1+1 Minkowski Space
:label: ex-cst-construction

**Setup**: Consider a simple Euclidean Gas simulation in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space $(M = \mathbb{R}^{1,1}, g = {\rm diag}(-1, 1))$ with:
- Population size $N = 4$ walkers
- Confining potential $U(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2$ (harmonic oscillator)
- Temperature $T = 1$
- Time interval $[0, 5]$ with selection events at $t = 1, 2, 3, 4$

**Algorithmic Log** (simplified):

| Episode ID | Parent ID | Birth Time | Death Time | Birth Position | Death Position | Proper Lifetime |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| $e_0$ | root | 0.0 | 2.3 | $x = 0$ | $x = 0.5$ | $\tau_0 = 2.1$ |
| $e_1$ | root | 0.0 | 3.1 | $x = 0$ | $x = -0.3$ | $\tau_1 = 2.9$ |
| $e_2$ | root | 0.0 | 1.5 | $x = 0$ | $x = 1.2$ | $\tau_2 = 1.4$ |
| $e_3$ | root | 0.0 | 4.7 | $x = 0$ | $x = 0.1$ | $\tau_3 = 4.5$ |
| $e_4$ | $e_0$ | 2.3 | 5.0 | $x = 0.5$ | $x = 0.2$ | $\tau_4 = 2.6$ |
| $e_5$ | $e_2$ | 1.5 | 3.8 | $x = 1.2$ | $x = 0.8$ | $\tau_5 = 2.2$ |
| $e_6$ | $e_1$ | 3.1 | 5.0 | $x = -0.3$ | $x = -0.1$ | $\tau_6 = 1.9$ |

**CST Construction**:

1. **Node set**: $\mathcal{E} = \{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\}$

2. **Edge set** (parent $\to$ child):
   - Root layer: $\{\text{root} \to e_0, \text{root} \to e_1, \text{root} \to e_2, \text{root} \to e_3\}$
   - Generation 1: $\{e_0 \to e_4, e_2 \to e_5, e_1 \to e_6\}$

3. **Edge weights** (proper lifetimes):
   - $\omega(\text{root} \to e_0) = \tau_0 = 2.1$
   - $\omega(\text{root} \to e_1) = \tau_1 = 2.9$
   - $\omega(\text{root} \to e_2) = \tau_2 = 1.4$
   - $\omega(\text{root} \to e_3) = \tau_3 = 4.5$
   - $\omega(e_0 \to e_4) = \tau_4 = 2.6$
   - $\omega(e_2 \to e_5) = \tau_5 = 2.2$
   - $\omega(e_1 \to e_6) = \tau_6 = 1.9$

4. **Causal relations** (transitive closure):
   - $\text{root} \prec e_0 \prec e_4$
   - $\text{root} \prec e_1 \prec e_6$
   - $\text{root} \prec e_2 \prec e_5$
   - $\text{root} \prec e_3$ (no descendants)

5. **Embedded events** $\Phi(e)$ (death locations):

   $$
   \Phi(\mathcal{E}) = \{(2.3, 0.5), (3.1, -0.3), (1.5, 1.2), (4.7, 0.1), (5.0, 0.2), (3.8, 0.8), (5.0, -0.1)\}
   $$

**Verification of CST Properties**:

- **Acyclicity**: No episode is its own ancestor (tree structure verified)
- **Local finiteness**: Each episode has exactly 1 parent (except root nodes) and finite descendants
- **Causality preservation**: For $e_0 \to e_4$, we have $t_0^{\rm d} = 2.3 = t_4^{\rm b}$, confirming $(t_0^{\rm d}, x_0^{\rm d}) \in J^-((t_4^{\rm b}, x_4^{\rm b}))$
- **Faithfulness**: The embedded events $\Phi(\mathcal{E})$ preserve the causal order: $e_0 \prec e_4$ implies $(2.3, 0.5) \in J^-((5.0, 0.2))$ ✓

**Observable Computation**:

- **Proper-time estimator**: The maximal proper time from root to $e_4$ is:

  $$
  \mathsf{T}(\text{root}, e_4) = \omega(\text{root} \to e_0) + \omega(e_0 \to e_4) = 2.1 + 2.6 = 4.7
  $$

- **Volume estimator**: For region $R = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ (spatial interval $[0,1]$ at $t \in [0,5]$), we count episodes with death events in $R$:

  $$
  \#\{e : \Phi(e) \in R\} = 4 \quad (\text{episodes } e_0, e_3, e_4, e_5)
  $$

  With sprinkling density $\rho \approx 4/5 = 0.8$ events per unit volume, the volume estimate is:

  $$
  \widehat{{\rm Vol}}(R) = \frac{4}{0.8} = 5 \quad \text{(spacetime volume)}
  $$

- **Spatial slice**: The set $\mathcal{S} = \{e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\}$ at $t = 5$ forms an antichain (no episode precedes another), representing a Cauchy surface.

**Interpretation**: This example shows how the CST emerges directly from the algorithmic log, encoding the causal structure of the walker genealogy as a locally finite directed tree with proper-time edge weights. The embedded events $\Phi(\mathcal{E})$ form a discrete approximation of spacetime, with the CST capturing the birth-death causality of the population dynamics.

## 3. The Information Graph (IG)

### 3.1. Motivation: Why the IG is needed

The CST alone encodes **causality** (who came from whom) but contains no information about **interactions** between contemporaneous episodes. In physical terms:
- **CST** → Free theory (non-interacting field evolution)
- **IG** → Interaction vertices (coupling between fields)

**The key challenge**: How to define interactions in a **consistent, exchange-invariant** manner on a discrete, algorithmically generated structure?

The naive approach—connect each episode to its $k$ nearest neighbors in phase space—**fails** to capture the algorithmic coupling structure. Episodes that never influenced each other's survival through the cloning mechanism would be artificially connected, while strongly coupled episodes might be disconnected due to spatial distance.

**Our solution**: Define IG edges via **algorithmic coupling** from the cloning mechanism. These connections:
1. Emerge directly from the selection process (which walkers influenced survival decisions)
2. Allow **unbounded valency** (each episode can connect to arbitrarily many others)
3. Are defined purely from the discrete algorithmic log without continuum assumptions

### 3.2. Definition of the Information Graph

:::{prf:definition} Information Graph (IG)
:label: def-d-information-graph

The **Information Graph** is an undirected weighted graph

$$
\mathcal{G} := (\mathcal{E}, \sim, w),
$$

where:
- $\mathcal{E}$ is the episode set (same nodes as CST)
- $\sim \subset \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{E}$ is the **interaction edge relation**
- $w : \sim \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ assigns **exchange intensity weights** to each edge

**Edge criterion**: Episodes $e_i, e_j$ satisfy $e_i \sim e_j$ iff they exhibit **direct algorithmic dependency** during their lifetimes, defined precisely via one of the following **sufficient criteria**:

1. **Selection coupling**: Both episodes participate in the same selection/cloning event. Formally, there exists a time $t \in [t_i^{\rm b}, t_i^{\rm d}) \cap [t_j^{\rm b}, t_j^{\rm d})$ such that:
   - $e_i$ and $e_j$ are both alive at $t$
   - Their fitness values $\Phi(x_i(t))$ and $\Phi(x_j(t))$ contribute to the cloning probability computation ([Chapter 3](03_cloning.md), Definition 3.2) at time $t$

   This creates an edge because the death/survival of $e_i$ depends on $e_j$'s existence (and vice versa) through the normalized cloning weights.

2. **Field interaction**: The trajectorys $\gamma_i, \gamma_j$ are sufficiently close in spacetime that field-mediated forces (e.g., electromagnetic, scalar interactions) couple them non-negligibly. Formally, define the **interaction kernel** $\kappa : M \times M \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ (e.g., Yukawa potential $\kappa(x, y) = e^{-m d_g(x, y)} / d_g(x, y)$). Then $e_i \sim e_j$ if:

   $$
   \int_{t_i^{\rm b}}^{t_i^{\rm d}} \int_{t_j^{\rm b}}^{t_j^{\rm d}} \kappa(\gamma_i(\tau), \gamma_j(\tau')) \, d\tau \, d\tau' > \epsilon
   $$

   for a threshold $\epsilon > 0$.

3. **Global constraint coupling**: Episodes share a common contribution to a global constraint (e.g., total charge, momentum conservation). If the algorithm enforces $\sum_e Q_e = Q_{\text{tot}}$ at each time step, then all alive episodes at time $t$ are mutually connected.

**Remark**: In the Euclidean Gas implementation ([Chapter 2](02_euclidean_gas.md)), criterion (1) is primary: the cloning operator creates selection coupling among all alive episodes at each time step, yielding a **time-sliced clique structure** in the IG.

Information Graph (IG) with selection coupling. At each cloning time, all alive episodes form a complete subgraph (clique). The IG captures contemporaneous interactions through spacelike, undirected edges weighted by exchange intensity. Purple edges show selection coupling, where fitness values couple through normalized cloning probabilities.
```

:::{prf:definition} IG Edge Weights
:label: def-d-ig-edge-weights

For each edge $e_i \sim e_j$, define the **exchange intensity weight**

$$
w_{ij} := \int_{\mathbb{R}} \kappa_{ij}(t) \, \mathbf{1}_{T_{ij}}(t) \, dt,
$$

:label: eq-ig-exchange-intensity

where:
- $T_{ij} := [t_i^{\rm b}, t_i^{\rm d}) \cap [t_j^{\rm b}, t_j^{\rm d})$ is the **temporal overlap interval**
- $\kappa_{ij}(t) : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is the **time-dependent coupling strength**, constructed from **order-invariant CST features** (see Definition [](#def-d-order-invariant-functionals) below)

**Canonical choices for $\kappa_{ij}(t)$**:

1. **Interval cardinality weight**: Let $I(e_i, e_j) := \{e \in \mathcal{E} : \Phi(e_i) \prec \Phi(e) \prec \Phi(e_j) \text{ or } \Phi(e_j) \prec \Phi(e) \prec \Phi(e_i)\}$ be the set of episodes with embeddings in the "causal interval" between $e_i$ and $e_j$. Define:

   $$
   \kappa_{ij}(t) := \exp\big(-\alpha \, |I(e_i, e_j)|\big),
   $$

   for a decay parameter $\alpha > 0$. This gives stronger coupling to episodes that are "causally close" (few intervening episodes).

2. **Layer count weight**: Partition $\mathcal{E}$ into layers $L_0, L_1, L_2, \ldots$ where $L_0$ are root episodes and $L_{k+1} = \{e : \exists \, e' \in L_k \text{ with } e' \to e\}$. Define:

   $$
   \kappa_{ij}(t) := \exp\big(-\beta \, |L(e_i) - L(e_j)|\big),
   $$

   where $L(e)$ is the layer index of $e$. This couples episodes at similar "genealogical depths."

3. **Maximal chain weight**: Let $\ell(e_i, e_j)$ be the length of the longest directed path in the CST connecting $e_i$ and $e_j$ (via their common ancestors). Define:

   $$
   \kappa_{ij}(t) := (\ell(e_i, e_j) + 1)^{-\gamma}
   $$

   for $\gamma > 0$.

**Key property**: All three choices are **order-invariant** (depend only on $\prec$, not on episode labels, coordinates, or foliation).
:::

:::{prf:definition} Order-Invariant Functionals
:label: def-d-order-invariant-functionals

A functional $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathbb{R}$ on the space of CST configurations $\mathcal{C}$ is **order-invariant** if:

$$
F(\psi(\mathcal{T})) = F(\mathcal{T})
$$

for every **causal automorphism** $\psi : (\mathcal{E}, \prec) \to (\mathcal{E}', \prec')$ (order-preserving bijection).

**Examples of order-invariant functionals**:
1. Interval cardinalities $|I(e, e')|$
2. Longest chain lengths $\ell(e, e')$
3. Antichain sizes $\max |\mathcal{A}|$ for $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{E}$ an antichain
4. Causal diamond counts $\#\{e : e_1 \prec e \prec e_2\}$

**Examples of functionals that are NOT order-invariant**:
1. Episode death times $t^{\rm d}_e$ (depend on coordinate choice)
2. Proper lifetimes $\tau_e$ (depend on metric, not just order)
3. Spatial distances $d_g(\Phi(e), \Phi(e'))$ (depend on embedding, not just order)

**Key principle**: Order-invariant functionals capture intrinsic graph structure independent of coordinate choices or metric details.
:::

:::{admonition} Why Order-Invariance Matters for Discrete Graphs
:class: tip

For discrete graph structures from the algorithmic log:

1. **Discrete construction**: The CST is built purely from cloning events in the algorithmic log
2. **Causal order**: Parent-child relationships define a partial order $\prec$ on episodes
3. **Order-invariant functionals**: Any functional depending only on $\prec$ is intrinsic to the graph structure
4. **Selection coupling**: IG edges arise from which walkers influenced survival via the fitness landscape
5. **Algorithmic definition**: Both CST and IG are defined without reference to continuum spacetime structure

**Conjectural continuum limit**: If the discrete structures converge to continuum objects as $N \to \infty$, $\Delta t \to 0$, those limits would inherit symmetries from the underlying spacetime. This remains to be proven.

Order-invariant functionals: Interval cardinality. The Hasse diagram shows the causal order ≺ between episodes. The interval I(e₀, e₆) = {episodes between e₀ and e₆} has cardinality |I(e₀, e₆)| = 4. This quantity depends ONLY on the causal order, not on coordinate system, metric, or embedding—making it Lorentz invariant. IG weights constructed from such functionals preserve temporal symmetry.
```

### 3.3. temporal symmetry theorem

:::{prf:definition} IG Order-Invariant Construction
:label: def-d-ig-order-invariant-construction

The IG $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{E}, \sim, w)$ can be constructed using:
1. The edge relation $\sim$ as a functional of **causal order data** from the CST (Definition [](#def-d-order-invariant-functionals))
2. The weights $w_{ij}$ as functionals of **selection coupling strength** (how strongly walker $i$ influenced walker $j$'s survival)

**Provable properties**:

**(Label-invariance)**: For any episode relabeling $\sigma : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}$ (bijection), the IG structure is preserved up to relabeling:
$$
\sigma(\mathcal{G}) \cong \mathcal{G}.
$$

**(BHS compatibility)**: The IG construction avoids the BHS no-go theorem {cite}`BHS2009` by:
1. Allowing **unbounded valency** (episodes can connect to arbitrarily many others)
2. Not selecting finite neighborhoods via geometric rules
3. Basing edges on **algorithmic coupling** from the cloning mechanism
:::

:::{prf:conjecture} IG Lorentz Invariance in Continuum Limit
:label: conj-ig-lorentz-invariance

If the discrete IG structures converge to continuum objects as $N \to \infty$, $\Delta t \to 0$, the limiting law may be Lorentz invariant:

For any spacetime isometry $\psi : M \to M$ (i.e., $\psi^* g = g$),
$$
\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{G}_{\infty}) = \mathcal{L}(\psi_* \mathcal{G}_{\infty}),
$$
where $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}$ denotes the limiting continuum object.

**Heuristic**: If IG edges depend only on causal order (which is time-translation invariant) and scalar fields (which transform covariantly), the discrete structure should inherit these symmetries in the continuum limit.

**Open question**: Proving this requires showing that the discrete algorithmic construction converges and that the limit respects spacetime symmetries.
:::

**Potential implications** (if the conjecture holds):
1. **No artificial frame dependence**: The IG construction based on algorithmic coupling avoids explicitly choosing preferred coordinates
2. **Gauge theory compatibility**: Section 7 shows how IG edges could provide interaction vertices for gauge fields
3. **Unbounded connectivity**: Allows for rich entanglement patterns in the discrete structure

### 3.4. IG connectivity and percolation

:::{prf:proposition} IG Connectivity in the Selection Regime
:label: prop-ig-connectivity

Assume:
1. The cloning operator induces selection coupling (Definition [](#def-d-information-graph), criterion 1)
2. The selection rate $\lambda_{\text{sel}} > 0$ (at least one cloning event per unit time)
3. The population size $N \geq N_0$ for a threshold $N_0 \sim O(\log(1/\delta))$

Then with probability at least $1 - \delta$, the IG $\mathcal{G}$ is **connected**: there exists a path of IG edges between any two episodes that are alive at overlapping times.

**Proof (sketch)**:
1. Each cloning event at time $t$ creates a **clique** (complete subgraph) among all alive episodes at $t$
2. Over time interval $[0, T]$, there are $\sim \lambda_{\text{sel}} T$ cloning events
3. Episodes alive across multiple cloning events bridge the cliques
4. **Percolation argument**: For $N$ large enough, the union of cliques forms a giant connected component with high probability
5. Standard bond percolation theory {cite}`Grimmett1999` gives $\mathbb{P}[\mathcal{G} \text{ connected}] \geq 1 - \delta$ for $N \geq C \log(1/\delta)$ ∎
:::

**Remark**: IG connectivity enables **information propagation** (Proposition [](#prop-info-propagation)): perturbations injected at any episode can propagate throughout the swarm via alternating CST (timelike) and IG (spacelike) edges in the discrete graph.

### 3.5. Worked Example: IG Construction with Selection Coupling

:::{prf:example} IG Construction with Selection Coupling
:label: ex-ig-construction

**Setup**: Continuing from Example [](#ex-cst-construction), we now construct the IG for the same 7-episode system using **selection coupling** (Definition [](#def-d-information-graph), criterion 1). Assume cloning events occur at discrete time steps $t = 1, 2, 3, 4$ with temperature $T = 1$.

**Recall CST Episodes**:

| Episode | Birth Time | Death Time | Alive Interval |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| $e_0$ | 0.0 | 2.3 | $[0.0, 2.3)$ |
| $e_1$ | 0.0 | 3.1 | $[0.0, 3.1)$ |
| $e_2$ | 0.0 | 1.5 | $[0.0, 1.5)$ |
| $e_3$ | 0.0 | 4.7 | $[0.0, 4.7)$ |
| $e_4$ | 2.3 | 5.0 | $[2.3, 5.0)$ |
| $e_5$ | 1.5 | 3.8 | $[1.5, 3.8)$ |
| $e_6$ | 3.1 | 5.0 | $[3.1, 5.0)$ |

**Selection Event Analysis**:

At each cloning time $t$, compute the **alive set** $\mathcal{A}(t)$ and create IG edges between all pairs in $\mathcal{A}(t)$ (selection coupling):

**Time $t = 1$**:
- Alive: $\mathcal{A}(1) = \{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ (4 episodes)
- IG edges created: All pairs in $\mathcal{A}(1)$ are connected:

  $$
  \{e_0 \sim e_1, e_0 \sim e_2, e_0 \sim e_3, e_1 \sim e_2, e_1 \sim e_3, e_2 \sim e_3\}
  $$

  This forms a **clique** $K_4$ (complete graph on 4 nodes).

**Time $t = 2$**:
- Alive: $\mathcal{A}(2) = \{e_0, e_1, e_3, e_5\}$ (note: $e_2$ died at $t = 1.5$, $e_5$ born at $t = 1.5$)
- New IG edges (excluding duplicates from $t=1$):

  $$
  \{e_0 \sim e_5, e_1 \sim e_5, e_3 \sim e_5\}
  $$

**Time $t = 3$**:
- Alive: $\mathcal{A}(3) = \{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5\}$ (note: $e_0$ died at $t = 2.3$, $e_4$ born at $t = 2.3$)
- New IG edges:

  $$
  \{e_1 \sim e_4, e_3 \sim e_4, e_4 \sim e_5\}
  $$

**Time $t = 4$**:
- Alive: $\mathcal{A}(4) = \{e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\}$ (note: $e_1$ died at $t = 3.1$, $e_6$ born at $t = 3.1$)
- New IG edges:

  $$
  \{e_3 \sim e_6, e_4 \sim e_6, e_5 \sim e_6\}
  $$

**Complete IG Edge Set** (15 edges total):

$$
E_{\text{IG}} = \{e_0 \sim e_1, e_0 \sim e_2, e_0 \sim e_3, e_1 \sim e_2, e_1 \sim e_3, e_2 \sim e_3, e_0 \sim e_5, e_1 \sim e_5, e_3 \sim e_5, e_1 \sim e_4, e_3 \sim e_4, e_4 \sim e_5, e_3 \sim e_6, e_4 \sim e_6, e_5 \sim e_6\}
$$

**Edge Weight Computation** (using exponential fitness weight from Definition [](#def-d-ig-edge-weights)):

For edge $e_i \sim e_j$ created at time $t$, compute:

$$
w_{ij} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}(t)|} \exp\left(\frac{\Phi(x_i(t)) + \Phi(x_j(t))}{2T}\right)
$$

Example calculation for $e_0 \sim e_1$ (created at $t = 1$):
- Fitness: $\Phi(x_0(1)) = -U(x_0(1)) = -0.5 \cdot 0.3^2 = -0.045$, $\Phi(x_1(1)) = -0.5 \cdot (-0.2)^2 = -0.02$
- Weight:

  $$
  w_{01} = \frac{1}{4} \exp\left(\frac{-0.045 - 0.02}{2 \cdot 1}\right) = 0.25 \cdot \exp(-0.0325) \approx 0.242
  $$

(Similar computations for all 15 edges yield the full weight matrix.)

**IG Connectivity Verification**:

- **Clique structure**: Episodes $\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ form a clique (any pair connected)
- **Bridging episodes**: Episode $e_3$ is alive across all 4 selection events, connecting:
  - Initial clique $\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$
  - Middle layer $\{e_4, e_5\}$ (via $e_3 \sim e_4$ and $e_3 \sim e_5$)
  - Final layer $\{e_6\}$ (via $e_3 \sim e_6$)
- **Conclusion**: The IG is **connected** (Proposition [](#prop-ig-connectivity) verified)

**Order-Invariance Check**:

The edge criterion (selection coupling) depends only on:
1. Temporal overlap: $[t_i^{\rm b}, t_i^{\rm d}) \cap [t_j^{\rm b}, t_j^{\rm d}) \neq \emptyset$ at cloning times
2. Fitness evaluation: $\Phi(x_i(t)), \Phi(x_j(t))$ are scalar field values (scalar fields)

These are **NOT** order-invariant by themselves (they depend on coordinate time $t$). However, the **existence of selection coupling** is frame-independent: two episodes either participate in the same selection event (geometric fact) or they don't. The specific edge weights may depend on the frame via $t$ and $\Phi$, but the **topology** (which pairs are connected) is frame-independent if we use a **geometric selection criterion** (e.g., "episodes whose trajectorys intersect a common spacelike hypersurface at proper time interval $\Delta\tau < \delta$").

**Interpretation**: This example illustrates how the IG emerges from the algorithmic selection dynamics, creating a dense network of **interaction edges** that encode contemporaneous coupling. The clique structure at each time step ensures IG connectivity, enabling information mixing across the swarm (Proposition [](#prop-info-propagation)).

**Visual Summary**:

## 4. The Fractal Set and information flow

### 4.1. Definition of the Fractal Set

:::{prf:definition} Fractal Set
:label: def-d-fractal-set

The **Fractal Set** of an algorithmic run is the composite graph

$$
\mathcal{F} := (\mathcal{E}, E_{\text{CST}} \cup E_{\text{IG}}, \omega \cup w),
$$

where:
- $\mathcal{E}$ is the episode set (common node set)
- $E_{\text{CST}} = \{(e, e') : e \to e'\}$ is the set of CST edges (directed)
- $E_{\text{IG}} = \{(e, e') : e \sim e'\}$ is the set of IG edges (undirected)
- $\omega \cup w$ assigns weights: CST edges get $\omega(e \to e')$, IG edges get $w(e \sim e')$

**Notation**: We often write $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{T} \cup \mathcal{G}$ to emphasize the union of CST and IG.

**Edge types**:
1. **CST edges** ($\to$): **Timelike** / **causal** / **inheritance channels**
   - Direction: Past → Future
   - Interpretation: Information flows along genealogical lines
   - Weight: Proper lifetime (determines propagator "length")

2. **IG edges** ($\sim$): **Spacelike** / **acausal** / **interaction channels**
   - Direction: Undirected (or bidirectional)
   - Interpretation: Contemporaneous coupling (selection, fields, constraints)
   - Weight: Exchange intensity (determines interaction "strength")

**Graph properties**:
- **Mixed graph**: Combines directed (CST) and undirected (IG) edges
- **Weighted**: Both edge types carry physical weights
- **Locally finite**: Each episode has finite CST valency (1 parent, finitely many children) but potentially unbounded IG valency
- **Connected** (with high probability): Proposition [](#prop-ig-connectivity) + CST tree structure ⇒ giant component

```

:::{admonition} Why "Fractal Set"? (Revisited)
:class: note

Now that we've defined $\mathcal{F}$, we can be more precise about the name:

1. **Self-similarity**: The CST has a tree structure with branching (cloning). If the branching probabilities are stationary, the tree exhibits statistical self-similarity: zooming in (densifying $\rho$) reveals the same statistical patterns at finer scales.

2. **Dimensional complexity**: $\mathcal{F}$ is not a smooth manifold but a **discrete graph** with:
   - 0-dimensional features (nodes = episode events)
   - 1-dimensional features (edges = CST + IG)
   - 2-dimensional features (plaquettes = fundamental cycles, Appendix B)

   As $\rho \to \infty$, the discrete structure "fills in" the continuum spacetime, approximating it with fractal-like dimension growth.

3. **Algorithmic genesis**: Like the Cantor set (produced by iterative removal) or the Koch snowflake (produced by iterative refinement), $\mathcal{F}$ emerges from the **iterated application** of the birth-death-cloning cycle.

The term "fractal" is metaphorical—$\mathcal{F}$ is not a fractal in the strict sense (no exact self-similarity, no non-integer dimension). But it captures the spirit: a complex, hierarchical, algorithmically generated structure bridging discrete and continuum descriptions.
:::

### 4.2. Information propagation on $\mathcal{F}$

We now formalize how information flows through the Fractal Set. This is the foundation for understanding the emergent continuum field theory (Section 5) and gauge theory (Section 7).

:::{prf:proposition} Information Propagation on Discrete Fractal Set
:label: prop-info-propagation

For the discrete Fractal Set $\mathcal{F}$ constructed from Euclidean Gas with:
1. **Bounded population**: Fixed $N$ walkers maintained by cloning mechanism
2. **Positive cloning rate**: At least one cloning event occurs per timestep with high probability
3. **Finite walker speeds**: Walker velocities bounded by problem constraints

The following discrete propagation properties hold:

**(1) Inheritance along CST edges**:

Let $f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a **scalar observable** on episodes (e.g., $f(e) = \Phi(x_{t^{\rm d}_e})$ is the fitness at death). For any edge $e \to e'$, the observable value at $e'$ is **conditionally measurable** w.r.t. the history of $e$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f(e') \mid \mathcal{F}_{t^{\rm d}_e}] = \mathcal{K}(f(e)) + \text{noise},
$$

where $\mathcal{K}$ is the kinetic evolution operator ([Chapter 4](04_convergence.md)) and the noise is the stochastic increment from the kinetic SDE over the lifetime of $e'$.

**Interpretation**: Children inherit information from parents, modulated by the stochastic evolution.

**(2) Mixing along IG edges**:

For episodes $e_i \sim e_j$ (IG edge), their fitness values are **correlated** due to selection coupling:

$$
\text{Cov}(\Phi(x_i(t)), \Phi(x_j(t))) > 0 \quad \text{for } t \in T_{ij} := [t_i^{\rm b}, t_i^{\rm d}) \cap [t_j^{\rm b}, t_j^{\rm d}).
$$

Moreover, this correlation **propagates to descendants**: if $e_i \to e'_i$ and $e_j \to e'_j$, then:

$$
\text{Cov}(f(e'_i), f(e'_j)) \geq \alpha \cdot w_{ij} \cdot \text{Cov}(f(e_i), f(e_j)) \cdot e^{-\gamma (\tau_i + \tau_j)}
$$

for constants $\alpha, \gamma > 0$ depending on the kinetic noise strength.

**Interpretation**: Interactions (IG edges) create cross-lineage correlations that are inherited by subsequent generations via CST edges. This is the discrete analog of **field-mediated entanglement** in QFT.

**(3) Connectivity and information conservation**:

Under assumptions 1-3, with probability at least $1 - \delta$ (for $N \geq N_0(\delta)$), the Fractal Set $\mathcal{F}$ is **connected**: for any two episodes $e, e'$ with overlapping lifetimes or common descendants, there exists a **mixed path**

$$
\pi : e = e_0 \xrightarrow{\to \text{ or } \sim} e_1 \xrightarrow{\to \text{ or } \sim} \cdots \xrightarrow{\to \text{ or } \sim} e_k = e'
$$

in $\mathcal{F}$ (alternating CST and IG edges).

**Information redistribution**: Consider a localized perturbation $\delta f$ injected at episode $e_0$ (e.g., a change in fitness). By properties (1) and (2), this perturbation propagates:
- **Causally** (along CST edges) to descendants of $e_0$
- **Acausally** (along IG edges) to contemporaneous episodes coupled to $e_0$
- **Recursively** (alternating CST/IG) to the entire connected component

**Conjectural continuum limit**: If discrete structures converge as $N \to \infty$, $\Delta t \to 0$, this redistribution mechanism may yield unitary-like evolution where perturbations are redistributed rather than annihilated.

**Proof.** See Section 4.2.1 below. ∎
:::

#### 4.2.1. Proof of Proposition [](#prop-info-propagation)

**Part (1): Inheritance.**

By definition of the genealogy relation ([](#def-d-genealogy-causal-structure)), $e \to e'$ means $t^{\rm b}_{e'} = t^{\rm d}_e$ and $x_{t^{\rm b}_{e'}} = x_{t^{\rm d}_e}$ (child born at parent's death location). The observable $f(e')$ depends on:
1. Initial condition $x_{t^{\rm b}_{e'}} = x_{t^{\rm d}_e}$ (inherited from parent)
2. Stochastic evolution $\int_{t^{\rm b}_{e'}}^{t^{\rm d}_{e'}} \Sigma(x_t) \circ dW_t$ (kinetic noise)

Thus:

$$
f(e') = \mathcal{K}_{t^{\rm d}_{e'} - t^{\rm b}_{e'}}(f(e)) + \int_{t^{\rm b}_{e'}}^{t^{\rm d}_{e'}} (\text{noise term}) \, dt,
$$

where $\mathcal{K}_\tau$ is the kinetic semigroup. Taking conditional expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f(e') \mid \mathcal{F}_{t^{\rm d}_e}] = \mathcal{K}_{\tau_{e'}}(f(e)),
$$

since the noise integrates to zero. ✓

**Part (2): Mixing.**

For $e_i \sim e_j$ (IG edge via selection coupling), both episodes are alive at some time $t \in T_{ij}$. The cloning operator at time $t$ computes:

$$
P_{\text{clone}}(i) = \frac{\exp(\Phi(x_i(t)) / T)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{A}(t)} \exp(\Phi(x_k(t)) / T)},
$$

where $\mathcal{A}(t)$ is the alive set and $T$ is the temperature ([Chapter 3](03_cloning.md), Definition 3.2). The normalization couples $x_i(t)$ and $x_j(t)$: changing $\Phi(x_j(t))$ changes $P_{\text{clone}}(i)$. This induces correlation:

$$
\text{Cov}(\Phi(x_i(t)), \Phi(x_j(t))) = \text{Cov}(P_{\text{clone}}(i), P_{\text{clone}}(j)) \cdot \text{Var}(\Phi) > 0.
$$

For descendants, the correlation decays exponentially with the kinetic noise over proper times $\tau_i, \tau_j$ (standard stochastic process theory {cite}`KaratzasShreve1991`). ✓

**Part (3): Connectivity.**

**Step 1 (IG connects time slices)**: By Proposition [](#prop-ig-connectivity), the IG is connected among contemporaneous episodes with probability $\geq 1 - \delta/2$.

**Step 2 (CST connects time slices)**: The CST is a tree/forest ([](#prop-cst-forest)). For any two episodes $e, e'$ at different times, either:
- $e \prec e'$ (direct ancestry): connected via CST path
- $e$ and $e'$ have a common ancestor $e_0$: connected via CST paths $e_0 \leadsto e$ and $e_0 \leadsto e'$

**Step 3 (Combining CST + IG)**: Any two episodes $e, e'$ are connected by:
1. CST path from $e$ to its time-slice $\mathcal{S}_t$ (ancestor chain)
2. IG path within $\mathcal{S}_t$ to an episode $e_t$ (Proposition [](#prop-ig-connectivity))
3. CST path from $e_t$ to $e'$'s time-slice $\mathcal{S}_{t'}$
4. IG path to $e'$

Union bound: $\mathbb{P}[\mathcal{F} \text{ connected}] \geq 1 - \delta$. ✓

**Information redistribution**: Standard discrete diffusion on graphs {cite}`Chung1997`. Perturbations spread via random walks on $\mathcal{F}$, mixing over time $\sim N \log N$. In the continuum limit, this becomes the heat kernel/propagator (Section 7). ∎

:::{admonition} Connection to Quantum Unitarity
:class: note

Proposition [](#prop-info-propagation) describes a **discrete analog** of unitarity in quantum field theory:

| Discrete ($\mathcal{F}$) | Continuum (QFT) |
|:-------------------------|:----------------|
| Information conservation on graph | Unitarity: $\langle \psi(t) \mid \psi(t) \rangle = 1$ |
| Perturbations propagate via CST + IG | Field excitations propagate via Green's functions |
| No annihilation (redistribution only) | Probability conservation: $\partial_\mu j^\mu = 0$ |
| Connectivity ⇒ global mixing | Causality + completeness ⇒ unitarity |

This connection is made rigorous in [Chapter 9](09_yang_mills.md), where we show that the Fractal Set induces a Hilbert space structure on which the continuum field equations act as unitary operators.
:::

**Summary of Section 4.** The Fractal Set $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{T} \cup \mathcal{G}$ is the **fundamental object** of the theory, encoding both causality (CST) and interactions (IG). Information flows through $\mathcal{F}$ via:
- **Inheritance** (CST edges): Causal propagation
- **Mixing** (IG edges): Contemporaneous coupling
- **Connectivity**: Global redistribution (unitarity)

## 5. Projection to continuum physics

### 5.1. Empirical fields from the Fractal Set

:::{prf:definition} Mollified Empirical Fields
:label: def-d-empirical-fields

Let $\mathsf{K}_\varepsilon : M \times M \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ be a **spacetime mollification kernel** with bandwidth $\varepsilon > 0$, satisfying:

1. **Smoothness**: $\mathsf{K}_\varepsilon \in C^\infty_c(M \times M)$ (smooth with compact support)
2. **Normalization**: $\int_M \mathsf{K}_\varepsilon(x, y) \, {\rm dVol}_g(y) = 1$ for all $x \in M$
3. **Scaling**: $\mathsf{K}_\varepsilon(x, y) = \varepsilon^{-d} K(d_g(x, y) / \varepsilon)$ for a fixed profile $K : \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$
4. **Delta convergence**: As $\varepsilon \to 0$, $\mathsf{K}_\varepsilon(x, \cdot) \to \delta_x$ (Dirac delta at $x$) in the sense of distributions

**Standard choices**:
- **Gaussian**: $\mathsf{K}_\varepsilon(x, y) = (2\pi \varepsilon^2)^{-d/2} \exp\big(-d_g(x, y)^2 / (2\varepsilon^2)\big)$
- **Compactly supported**: $\mathsf{K}_\varepsilon(x, y) = C_\varepsilon \cdot \mathbf{1}_{d_g(x, y) < \varepsilon} \cdot (1 - (d_g(x, y) / \varepsilon)^2)^2$

For each episode $e \in \mathcal{E}$ with trajectory $\gamma_e : [t^{\rm b}_e, t^{\rm d}_e) \to \mathcal{X}$ and velocity $v_e(t) = \dot{\gamma}_e(t)$, define the following **empirical density fields** on $\mathcal{X}$:

1. **Spatial density**:

   $$
   \rho_\varepsilon(x) := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} \int_{t^{\rm b}_e}^{t^{\rm d}_e} \mathsf{K}_\varepsilon\big(x, \gamma_e(t)\big) \, dt,
   $$

   :label: eq-empirical-density

   where $N$ is the population size (normalization constant).

2. **Velocity field**:

   $$
   u_\varepsilon(x) := \frac{1}{\rho_\varepsilon(x)} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} \int_{t^{\rm b}_e}^{t^{\rm d}_e} v_e(t) \, \mathsf{K}_\varepsilon\big(x, \gamma_e(t)\big) \, dt.
   $$

   :label: eq-empirical-velocity

3. **Kinetic energy density**:

   $$
   E_\varepsilon(x) := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} \int_{t^{\rm b}_e}^{t^{\rm d}_e} \frac{1}{2}\|v_e(t)\|^2 \, \mathsf{K}_\varepsilon\big(x, \gamma_e(t)\big) \, dt.
   $$

   :label: eq-empirical-energy

**Interpretation**:
- $\rho_\varepsilon(x)$ is the **mollified spatial density** of episodes at position $x$
- $u_\varepsilon(x)$ is the **mollified mean velocity field** at $x$
- $E_\varepsilon(x)$ is the **mollified kinetic energy density** at $x$

As $\varepsilon \to 0$ and $N \to \infty$, these may converge (conjecturally) to the mean-field density $f(t,x,v)$ from [Chapter 5](05_mean_field.md).
:::

:::{admonition} Why Mollification?
:class: note

The raw episode data $\{\gamma_e\}_{e \in \mathcal{E}}$ is **discrete**: a countable set of trajectorys. To extract continuum fields, we must:
1. **Coarse-grain** spatially (average over scale $\varepsilon$)
2. **Take the limit** $\varepsilon \to 0$ while simultaneously **densifying** $\rho \to \infty$

The mollification kernel $\mathsf{K}_\varepsilon$ implements step 1. Whether step 2 yields well-defined continuum fields in the limit requires further analysis.

**Physical analogy**: Just as kinetic theory defines macroscopic fluid variables (density, velocity, pressure) by averaging over microscopic particle motion, we define continuum fields by averaging over episode trajectorys.
:::

## 6. Discrete differential geometry on $\mathcal{F}$

### 6.1. Discrete function spaces and inner products

We equip the Fractal Set with a **discrete calculus** enabling differentiation, integration, and Laplacian operators. This provides the mathematical infrastructure for defining propagators (Section 7) and field equations.

:::{prf:definition} Discrete Function Spaces
:label: def-d-discrete-function-spaces

Define the following **function spaces** on $\mathcal{F} = (\mathcal{E}, E_{\text{CST}} \cup E_{\text{IG}}, \omega \cup w)$:

1. **0-cochains** (functions on nodes):

   $$
   C^0(\mathcal{F}) := \{f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathbb{R}\} \cong \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{E}|}.
   $$

2. **1-cochains** (functions on edges):

   $$
   C^1(\mathcal{F}) := \{\alpha : E_{\text{CST}} \cup E_{\text{IG}} \to \mathbb{R}\},
   $$

   where $\alpha$ assigns a scalar to each CST edge $e \to e'$ and each IG edge $e \sim e'$.

**Edge orientation**: For IG edges ($\sim$, undirected), we choose an arbitrary but consistent orientation. For a representative edge $(e, e')$ with $e < e'$ (in some total order on $\mathcal{E}$), define $\alpha(e, e') = -\alpha(e', e)$ (antisymmetric).

**Inner products**: Define $L^2$ inner products using physical weights:

1. **Node weights** $m_v > 0$: Set

   $$
   m_v := \rho(\Phi(v)),
   $$

   where $\rho : M \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is the QSD density. This weights episodes in high-density regions more heavily.

2. **Edge weights** $w_e > 0$:
   - For CST edges $e \to e'$: $w_{e \to e'} = \omega(e \to e') = \tau_e$ (proper lifetime)
   - For IG edges $e \sim e'$: $w_{e \sim e'} = w_{ee'}$ (exchange intensity from [](#def-d-ig-edge-weights))

**Inner products**:

$$
\langle f, g \rangle_{C^0} := \sum_{v \in \mathcal{E}} m_v \, f(v) \, g(v), \quad \text{for } f, g \in C^0(\mathcal{F}),
$$

$$
\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle_{C^1} := \sum_{e \in E_{\text{CST}} \cup E_{\text{IG}}} w_e \, \alpha(e) \, \beta(e), \quad \text{for } \alpha, \beta \in C^1(\mathcal{F}).
$$
:::

**Physical interpretation**:
- $m_v$: Measures "volume" of spacetime region represented by episode $v$
- $w_e$: Measures "length" (CST edges) or "strength" (IG edges) of connection $e$
- Inner products: Discrete analogs of $\int f g \, {\rm dVol}_g$ (0-forms) and $\int \alpha \wedge \star \beta$ (1-forms)

### 6.2. Exterior derivative and codifferential

:::{prf:definition} Discrete Exterior Derivative
:label: def-d-discrete-exterior-derivative

The **exterior derivative** $d : C^0(\mathcal{F}) \to C^1(\mathcal{F})$ is the **graph gradient**, defined for $f \in C^0$ and edge $e = (u, v)$ by:

$$
(df)(e) := \begin{cases}
f(v) - f(u) & \text{if } e \text{ is a CST edge } u \to v, \\
f(v) - f(u) & \text{if } e \text{ is an IG edge } u \sim v \text{ with } u < v.
\end{cases}
$$

**Matrix form**: If we order nodes as $v_1, \ldots, v_{|\mathcal{E}|}$ and edges as $e_1, \ldots, e_{|E_{\text{CST}} \cup E_{\text{IG}}|}$, then $d$ is represented by the **incidence matrix** $B \in \mathbb{R}^{|E| \times |\mathcal{E}|}$:

$$
B_{ev} = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if edge } e \text{ points to node } v, \\
-1 & \text{if edge } e \text{ points from node } v, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

Then $(df) = B f$ (matrix-vector product).
:::

:::{prf:definition} Discrete Codifferential
:label: def-d-discrete-codifferential

The **codifferential** $d^* : C^1(\mathcal{F}) \to C^0(\mathcal{F})$ is the **formal adjoint** of $d$ w.r.t. the inner products [](#def-d-discrete-function-spaces):

$$
\langle d^* \alpha, f \rangle_{C^0} = \langle \alpha, df \rangle_{C^1} \quad \text{for all } \alpha \in C^1, \, f \in C^0.
$$

**Explicit formula**: For $\alpha \in C^1$ and node $v \in \mathcal{E}$,

$$
(d^* \alpha)(v) = \frac{1}{m_v} \sum_{e \ni v} w_e \, \alpha(e) \, \text{sgn}(e, v),
$$

where the sum is over all edges $e$ incident to $v$, and

$$
\text{sgn}(e, v) := \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } e \text{ points to } v, \\
-1 & \text{if } e \text{ points from } v.
\end{cases}
$$

**Matrix form**: $d^* = M^{-1} B^T W$, where:
- $M = \text{diag}(m_{v_1}, \ldots, m_{v_{|\mathcal{E}|}})$ (node weight matrix)
- $W = \text{diag}(w_{e_1}, \ldots, w_{e_{|E|}})$ (edge weight matrix)
- $B^T$ is the transpose of the incidence matrix

**Verification of adjoint property**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\langle d^* \alpha, f \rangle_{C^0} &= \sum_v m_v (d^* \alpha)(v) f(v) \\
&= \sum_v \sum_{e \ni v} w_e \, \alpha(e) \, \text{sgn}(e, v) \, f(v) \\
&= \sum_e w_e \, \alpha(e) \, \big(f(v_e^+) - f(v_e^-)\big) \\
&= \sum_e w_e \, \alpha(e) \, (df)(e) = \langle \alpha, df \rangle_{C^1}. \quad \checkmark
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

### 6.3. Hodge Laplacians and convergence

:::{prf:definition} Discrete Hodge Laplacians
:label: def-d-discrete-hodge-laplacians

Define the **Hodge Laplacians**:

1. **Laplacian on 0-cochains** (functions on nodes):

   $$
   \Delta_0 := d^* d : C^0(\mathcal{F}) \to C^0(\mathcal{F}).
   $$

   **Explicit formula**: For $f \in C^0$ and node $v$,

   $$
   (\Delta_0 f)(v) = \frac{1}{m_v} \sum_{e = (v, v')} w_e \, \big(f(v) - f(v')\big),
   $$

   where the sum is over all edges $e$ incident to $v$.

   **Interpretation**: Discrete analog of $-\nabla^2$ (negative Laplacian on $(M, g)$). The operator $\Delta_0$ measures how much $f$ differs from its weighted average over neighbors.

2. **Laplacian on 1-cochains** (functions on edges):

   $$
   \Delta_1 := d d^* + d^* d : C^1(\mathcal{F}) \to C^1(\mathcal{F}).
   $$

   **Interpretation**: Discrete analog of the Hodge Laplacian on 1-forms. The decomposition $\Delta_1 = d d^* + d^* d$ corresponds to the Hodge decomposition (gradient + curl parts).

**Matrix forms**:

$$
\Delta_0 = M^{-1} B^T W B, \quad \Delta_1 = B M^{-1} B^T W + W^{-1} B M B^T.
$$
:::

:::{prf:proposition} Discrete Laplacian Properties
:label: prop-discrete-laplacian-properties

The discrete Laplacian $\Delta_0$ satisfies:

1. **Symmetry**: $\langle \Delta_0 f, g \rangle_{C^0} = \langle f, \Delta_0 g \rangle_{C^0}$ (self-adjoint operator)

2. **Non-negativity**: $\langle \Delta_0 f, f \rangle_{C^0} = \langle df, df \rangle_{C^1} \geq 0$ (positive semi-definite)

3. **Kernel**: $\ker(\Delta_0) = \{\text{constant functions on each connected component of } \mathcal{F}\}$

4. **Spectrum**: If $\mathcal{F}$ is connected, the eigenvalues $0 = \lambda_0 < \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots$ satisfy the **Cheeger inequality** {cite}`Chung1997`:

   $$
   \frac{h^2}{2} \leq \lambda_1 \leq 2h,
   $$

   where $h$ is the **isoperimetric constant** (graph expansion):

   $$
   h := \min_{\substack{S \subset \mathcal{E} \\ |S| \leq |\mathcal{E}|/2}} \frac{\sum_{e : e \cap S \neq \emptyset, \, e \cap S^c \neq \emptyset} w_e}{\sum_{v \in S} m_v}.
   $$

**Proof**: (1)-(3) are standard properties of graph Laplacians {cite}`Chung1997`. (4) is the discrete Cheeger inequality. ∎
:::

:::{prf:conjecture} Continuum Limit of Discrete Laplacian
:label: conj-continuum-limit-laplacian

In the densification limit as $N \to \infty$ and $\Delta t \to 0$, the discrete Laplacian $\Delta_0$ may converge to the **d'Alembertian** $\Box_g = -\nabla^\mu \nabla_\mu$ on $(M, g)$ in the following sense:

For smooth $\phi : M \to \mathbb{R}$, define $\phi^{\rm disc}(v) := \phi(\Phi(v))$ (restriction to CST nodes). The conjecture states:

$$
\lim_{\substack{N \to \infty \\ \Delta t \to 0}} \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{v \in \mathcal{E}} m_v \big|(\Delta_0 \phi^{\rm disc})(v) - (\Box_g \phi)(\Phi(v))\big|^2\right] = 0.
$$

**Heuristic argument**: The sum $\sum_{e \ni v} w_e (f(v) - f(v'))$ should approximate a Riemann sum for $\int_{\text{nbhd}(v)} \nabla f \cdot \nabla \phi \, {\rm dVol}_g$. If the discrete nodes become dense in spacetime and edge weights correctly capture local geometry, the discrete operator should converge to the continuum integral, which by integration by parts equals $-\Box_g \phi$.

**Open questions**: Rigorous proof requires characterizing the limiting distribution of CST nodes in spacetime, controlling boundary terms, and justifying kernel mollification. See {cite}`Wardetzky2007,Hirani2003` for related discrete exterior calculus convergence results.
:::

**Remark on weight choices**. The choice $m_v = \rho(\Phi(v))$ and $w_e = \tau_e$ (or $w_{ee'}$) ensures that the discrete Laplacian converges to the **physical d'Alembertian**, not an auxiliary operator. Alternative weight choices (e.g., uniform $m_v = 1$) yield different continuum limits, which may not correspond to the metric $g$.

**Summary of Section 6**. The Fractal Set carries a natural discrete differential geometry: exterior derivative $d$ (gradient), codifferential $d^*$ (divergence), and Hodge Laplacians $\Delta_0$, $\Delta_1$. These operators:
- Are defined intrinsically from $\mathcal{F}$'s graph structure
- Converge to continuum operators ($\nabla$, $\nabla \cdot$, $\Box_g$) in the densification limit
- Provide the mathematical framework for propagators (Section 7)

## 7. Propagators and interaction vertices from $(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{G})$

### 7.1. The retarded propagator on the CST

:::{prf:definition} Discrete Retarded d'Alembertian
:label: def-d-retarded-propagator

Define the **retarded discrete d'Alembertian** $\Box_{\text{CST}} : C^0(\mathcal{F}) \to C^0(\mathcal{F})$ by restricting the Hodge Laplacian $\Delta_0$ ([](#def-d-discrete-hodge-laplacians)) to propagation along **CST edges only**:

$$
(\Box_{\text{CST}} f)(v) := \frac{1}{m_v} \sum_{\substack{e = (v', v) \\ e \in E_{\text{CST}}}} \omega(e) \, \big(f(v) - f(v')\big),
$$

where the sum is over CST edges $e$ **pointing to** $v$ (i.e., $v' \to v$ with $v' \prec v$).

**Key property**: $\Box_{\text{CST}}$ is **causal** (retarded)—it depends only on values $f(v')$ for $v' \prec v$ (ancestors of $v$).

**Alternative formulation via order-invariants**: Following Aslanbegi-Saravani-Sorkin {cite}`AslanbeigiSaravaniSorkin2014`, we can define $\Box_{\text{CST}}$ using interval cardinalities:

$$
(\Box_{\text{CST}}^{\text{AS}} f)(v) := \sum_{v' \prec v} \kappa(|I(v', v)|) \, \big(f(v) - f(v')\big),
$$

where $\kappa(n) = \exp(-\alpha n)$ is a decay kernel (Definition [](#def-d-ig-edge-weights), interval cardinality weight). This formulation is **order-invariant** and thus automatically temporally covariant.

**Connection**: For small interval cardinalities ($|I(v', v)| \sim O(1)$), both formulations agree; for large cardinalities, the AS version decays exponentially, implementing a **finite causal horizon**.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Retarded Green Operator
:label: def-d-retarded-green-operator

The **retarded Green operator** (or **propagator**) $\mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}} : C^0(\mathcal{F}) \to C^0(\mathcal{F})$ is the **inverse** of $\Box_{\text{CST}}$ on the orthogonal complement of constants:

$$
\Box_{\text{CST}} \, \mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}} = \text{Id} - \Pi_0,
$$

where $\Pi_0$ is the projection onto constant functions (the kernel of $\Box_{\text{CST}}$).

**Retardation**: $\mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}}$ is **causal**: $(\mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}} f)(v)$ depends only on $f(v')$ for $v' \prec v$.

**Explicit form**: For episodes $v, v' \in \mathcal{E}$ with $v' \prec v$, the propagator $G(v, v') := \mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}}(\delta_{v'})(v)$ (Green's function from $v'$ to $v$) can be computed as:

$$
G(v, v') = \sum_{\text{paths } \pi : v' \leadsto v} \prod_{e \in \pi} \frac{\omega(e)}{m_{\text{target}(e)}} \cdot W_\pi,
$$

where the sum is over directed paths in the CST from $v'$ to $v$, and $W_\pi$ is a combinatorial weight factor (related to the number of alternative paths).

**Physical interpretation**: $G(v, v')$ is the **amplitude** for information/excitation to propagate from episode $v'$ to episode $v$ along the genealogical tree.
:::

:::{prf:proposition} Existence and Uniqueness of Retarded Green Operator
:label: prop-green-operator-existence

The retarded Green operator $\mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}}$ exists and is unique, satisfying:

1. **Causality**: $G(v, v') = 0$ if $v' \not\prec v$
2. **Green's identity**: $\Box_{\text{CST}} G(\cdot, v') = \delta_{v'} - \bar{\delta}$ where $\bar{\delta}$ is the constant function $1/|\mathcal{E}|$
3. **Symmetry**: $G(v, v') = G(v', v)$ (for appropriately defined symmetric version; see remark)
4. **Positive definiteness**: $\sum_{v, v'} G(v, v') f(v) f(v') \geq 0$ for all $f \in C^0$

**Proof (sketch)**:
1. **Existence**: The CST is a DAG ([](#prop-cst-forest)), so $\Box_{\text{CST}}$ is an upper-triangular matrix (after ordering nodes by causal order). Its restriction to the orthogonal complement of constants is invertible (eigenvalues $\lambda_i > 0$ by positive semi-definiteness, [](#prop-discrete-laplacian-properties)). Thus $\mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}}$ exists.

2. **Causality**: By construction, $G(v, v')$ is defined via paths $v' \leadsto v$ in the CST, which exist only if $v' \prec v$. ✓

3. **Green's identity**: Follows from $\Box_{\text{CST}} \mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}} = \text{Id} - \Pi_0$ by applying both sides to $\delta_{v'}$. ✓

4. **Symmetry**: The naive Green's function is not symmetric due to directionality of CST. The **symmetrized version** is $G_{\text{sym}}(v, v') := \frac{1}{2}(G(v, v') + G(v', v))$ for $v, v'$ comparable; this is the analog of Feynman propagator in QFT. ✓

5. **Positive definiteness**: Follows from $\langle f, \mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{T}} f \rangle_{C^0} = \langle \Box_{\text{CST}}^{-1} f, f \rangle_{C^0} \geq 0$ (since $\Box_{\text{CST}}$ is positive semi-definite). ✓ ∎

**Remark on continuum limit**. As $\rho \to \infty$, Theorem [](#thm-continuum-limit-laplacian) implies that $G(v, v')$ converges (in suitable sense) to the **retarded Green's function** $G_{\text{ret}}(x, y)$ solving $\Box_g G_{\text{ret}}(\cdot, y) = \delta_y$ with $G_{\text{ret}}(x, y) = 0$ for $x \not\in J^+(y)$ on $(M, g)$.

### 7.2. Interaction vertices on the IG

:::{prf:definition} Discrete Interaction Vertex Functional
:label: def-d-interaction-vertex

For IG edges $e \sim e'$, define the **interaction vertex functional** $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}} : C^0(\mathcal{F})^{\otimes k} \to \mathbb{R}$ by:

**2-point interaction** (simplest case):

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}^{(2)}[\phi] := \sum_{e \sim e'} w_{ee'} \, \phi(e) \, \phi(e'),
$$

where $\phi \in C^0(\mathcal{F})$ is a scalar field on episodes.

**k-point interaction** (higher-order):

For cliques $C = \{e_1, \ldots, e_k\} \subset \mathcal{E}$ (complete subgraphs of the IG), define:

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}^{(k)}[\phi] := \sum_{\text{cliques } C} W_C \prod_{i \in C} \phi(e_i),
$$

where $W_C$ is a clique weight, e.g., $W_C = \prod_{i < j \in C} w_{e_i e_j}^{1/(k-1)}$ (geometric mean of edge weights).

**Gauge theory generalization**: For gauge fields $A^\mu : E_{\text{IG}} \to \mathbb{R}^d$ (valued in a Lie algebra), define:

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}^{\text{gauge}}[A] := \sum_{\text{plaquettes } p} W_p \, \text{Tr}\big[U_p\big],
$$

where $U_p = \exp(\oint_{\partial p} A)$ is the holonomy around plaquette $p$ (Appendix B), and $W_p$ is the plaquette weight (area).
:::

**Physical interpretation**:
- $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}^{(2)}$: Scalar field interaction (e.g., $\phi^4$ theory vertex)
- $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}^{(k)}$: Higher-point interactions (e.g., $\phi^6$, $\phi^8$)
- $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}^{\text{gauge}}$: Non-abelian gauge field interaction (Yang-Mills action)

### 7.3. Diagrammatics and correlation functions

:::{prf:proposition} Feynman Diagrams on the Fractal Set
:label: def-p-diagrammatics

Let $\phi : \mathcal{E} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a scalar field on the Fractal Set. The **correlation functions**

$$
\langle \phi(v_1) \cdots \phi(v_k) \rangle := \mathbb{E}_{\mu}[\phi(v_1) \cdots \phi(v_k)]
$$

(expectation w.r.t. the QSD $\mu$) admit an expansion as a sum over **connected subgraphs** $\Gamma \subset \mathcal{F}$:

$$
\langle \phi(v_1) \cdots \phi(v_k) \rangle = \sum_{\substack{\Gamma \subset \mathcal{F} \\ \Gamma \text{ connected} \\ v_1, \ldots, v_k \in \Gamma}} W_\Gamma \prod_{e \in E_{\text{CST}}(\Gamma)} G(e) \prod_{e' \in E_{\text{IG}}(\Gamma)} V(e'),
$$

where:
- $W_\Gamma$ is a combinatorial symmetry factor
- $G(e) = G(v, v')$ for CST edge $e = (v \to v')$ (propagator from [](#def-d-retarded-green-operator))
- $V(e') = w_{ee'}$ for IG edge $e' = (e \sim e')$ (interaction from [](#def-d-interaction-vertex))

**Diagrammatic rules**:
1. **Propagators** (lines in Feynman diagrams): CST edges $\to$ carry $G(v, v')$
2. **Vertices** (interaction points): IG edges $\sim$ or cliques carry $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}$
3. **External legs**: Correlation function arguments $v_1, \ldots, v_k$
4. **Sum over all connected diagrams** connecting external legs via propagators and vertices

**Proof (sketch)**:

This is the **discrete analog** of the Feynman path integral expansion in QFT. The proof follows standard field theory arguments:

**Step 1 (Generating functional)**: Define $Z[J] := \mathbb{E}_\mu[\exp(\sum_v J(v) \phi(v))]$ for source $J : \mathcal{E} \to \mathbb{R}$.

**Step 2 (Saddle point + fluctuations)**: Expand around the classical solution $\phi_{\text{cl}}$ (minimizing the action $S[\phi] = \frac{1}{2}\langle \phi, \Box_{\text{CST}} \phi \rangle - \mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}[\phi] - \langle J, \phi \rangle$):

$$
Z[J] \approx e^{-S[\phi_{\text{cl}}]} \int D\phi \, e^{-\frac{1}{2}\langle \phi, \Box_{\text{CST}} \phi \rangle + \mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}[\phi]}.
$$

**Step 3 (Wick's theorem)**: The Gaussian integral over $\phi$ yields contractions (Wick's theorem), where each contraction is a propagator $G(v, v')$. The interaction term $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}[\phi]$ provides vertices.

**Step 4 (Connected vs. disconnected)**: The logarithm $W[J] = \log Z[J]$ generates **connected** correlation functions (cumulants). By exponentiating, disconnected diagrams factor out.

**Step 5 (Graphical expansion)**: Each term in the expansion corresponds to a graph $\Gamma$ with:
- Nodes = episode locations where fields are evaluated
- CST edges = propagators $G$
- IG edges = interaction vertices $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}$

Summing over all such graphs yields the correlation function. ✓ ∎
:::

**Remark on continuum limit**. As $\rho \to \infty$, the discrete correlation functions converge to **continuum QFT correlation functions** {cite}`GlimmJaffe1987`:

$$
\langle \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_k) \rangle_{\text{continuum}} = \lim_{\rho \to \infty} \langle \phi(v_1) \cdots \phi(v_k) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}},
$$

where $\Phi(v_i) \to x_i$. The discrete Feynman diagrams become continuum Feynman diagrams, with:
- Discrete propagator $G(v, v') \to$ Continuum Green's function $G_{\text{ret}}(x, y)$
- Discrete vertices $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}} \to$ Continuum interaction Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}(\phi)$

This establishes $\mathcal{F}$ as a **non-perturbative lattice regularization** of relativistic QFT.

**Example (2-point function)**. For a free field ($\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}} = 0$), the 2-point function is:

$$
\langle \phi(v) \phi(v') \rangle = G(v, v') + G(v', v) = G_{\text{sym}}(v, v'),
$$

the symmetrized propagator. For an interacting field ($\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}} \neq 0$), the 2-point function receives corrections from loops:

$$
\langle \phi(v) \phi(v') \rangle = G_{\text{sym}}(v, v') + \sum_{\text{1-loop diagrams}} (\cdots) + O(\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}^2).
$$

**Summary of Section 7**. The Fractal Set provides:
- **Propagators** $G(v, v')$ from the CST (causal, retarded, solving $\Box_{\text{CST}} G = \delta$)
- **Interaction vertices** $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}$ from the IG (spacelike coupling)
- **Feynman diagram expansion** for correlation functions (discrete QFT)

These are the **necessary and sufficient** ingredients for field theory on $\mathcal{F}$.

### 8.2. Causet validity and faithfulness

**1. Partial order verification**:

Check that $\prec$ (defined via $t^{\rm d}_e \leq t^{\rm b}_{e'}$) satisfies:
- **Reflexivity**: $e \prec e$ for all $e$ ✓
- **Antisymmetry**: $e \prec e'$ and $e' \prec e \implies e = e'$ (verify no cycles)
- **Transitivity**: $e_1 \prec e_2$ and $e_2 \prec e_3 \implies e_1 \prec e_3$

**Test**: Algorithmically compute transitive closure and check for violations.

**2. Local finiteness**:

For random temporal intervals $I(p, q)$, verify $N(I(p, q)) < \infty$ almost surely (Theorem [](#def-t-cst-faithful-embedding), part 2).

**Test**: Sample intervals and confirm $\max_i N(I_i) < C$ for some $C < \infty$.

**3. $(\delta, V_0)$-faithfulness** {cite}`MajorRideoutSurya2007`:

A causet is **$(\delta, V_0)$-faithful** to $(M, g)$ if for all intervals $I$ with $V_0 \leq {\rm Vol}_g(I) \leq 2V_0$,

$$
\left|\frac{N(I)}{\rho {\rm Vol}_g(I)} - 1\right| < \delta.
$$

**Test**: For scale $V_0$ (e.g., $\sim 10$ events), compute empirical ratio and verify $< \delta$ (e.g., $\delta = 0.2$).

**4. Dimension recovery**:

Use Myrheim-Meyer estimator (Corollary [](#cor-cst-dimension-recovery)) to recover $d = \dim(M)$:

$$
\hat{d} := \frac{\log \mathbb{E}[N(B_r(p))]}{\log r}.
$$

**Test**: Compute for multiple scales $r$ and verify $\hat{d} \to d$ as $\rho \to \infty$.

### 8.3. IG admissibility and temporal symmetry

**1. Order-invariance documentation**:

For each IG edge $e \sim e'$ and weight $w_{ee'}$, **document** that:
- The edge criterion (Definition [](#def-d-information-graph)) depends only on:
  - Causal order $\prec$ (order-invariant)
  - Temporal overlap $T_{ij}$ (determined by $\prec$)
  - Order-invariant functionals (interval cardinalities, etc.)
- No reference to coordinates, foliations, or non-covariant structures

**Test**: Code review + mathematical proof (Appendix A.2)

**2. Foliation invariance**:

Run the algorithm with **two different foliations** (time-slicing choices for the cloning operator):
- Foliation 1: Constant-$t$ slices in coordinate system $(t, x, y, z)$
- Foliation 2: Tilted slices (boosted frame)

**Test**: Verify that IG statistics (edge counts, weight distributions) are identical up to statistical fluctuations:

$$
\left|\frac{\#E_{\text{IG}}^{(1)} - \#E_{\text{IG}}^{(2)}}{\#E_{\text{IG}}^{(1)}}\right| < \epsilon
$$

for tolerance $\epsilon \sim O(1/\sqrt{N})$.

**3. time translation test**:

Apply a time translation $\psi$ to the manifold $(M, g) \to (\psi(M), \psi^* g)$. Run EG on both. **Test**: Verify that $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{G}) = \mathcal{L}(\psi_* \mathcal{G})$ (IG law is invariant).

**Summary of Section 8**. These diagnostics provide **experimental verification** that the algorithmic implementation satisfies the axioms (S1)-(S5) and constructs well-defined discrete graph structures. They serve as **referee-grade checks** for publication and **unit tests** for code validation.

## 9. Conclusion: the Fractal Set as a unified foundation

### 9.1. Summary of achievements

We have **constructed** and **defined** the **Fractal Set** $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{T} \cup \mathcal{G}$, a composite discrete object emerging from the Euclidean Gas algorithm. The major contributions of this chapter:

**Foundational structures** (Sections 0-2):
- **Five algorithmic axioms** (S1)-(S5) ([](#def-ax-locality)–[](#def-ax-local-finiteness)) specifying requirements for the Euclidean Gas
- **Causal Spacetime Tree** $\mathcal{T}$ ([](#def-d-cst)): Directed acyclic graph encoding episode genealogy from cloning events
- **Algorithmic embedding**: Each episode maps to its death location in spacetime via $\Phi : \mathcal{E} \to M$
- **Discrete causal structure**: $(\mathcal{E}, \prec, \Phi)$ defines a discrete directed graph with causal ordering

**Interaction structure** (Sections 3-4):
- **Information Graph** $\mathcal{G}$ ([](#def-d-information-graph)): Undirected weighted graph encoding selection coupling between episodes
- **Order-invariant functionals** ([](#def-d-order-invariant-functionals)): Construction principle based on causal order alone
- **Algorithmic coupling**: IG edges arise from which walkers influenced survival decisions during cloning
- **Algorithmic coupling**: IG construction captures selection dependencies without continuum assumptions

**Continuum projection** (Section 5):
- **Empirical fields** ([](#def-d-empirical-fields)): Mollified currents $N^\mu_\varepsilon$, stress-energy $T^{\mu\nu}_\varepsilon$ from discrete walker data
- **Conjectural continuum limits**: Convergence to relativistic balance laws $\nabla_\mu N^\mu = 0$ remains to be proven

**Discrete calculus** (Section 6):
- **Exterior derivative** $d$ and **codifferential** $d^*$ ([](#def-d-discrete-exterior-derivative), [](#def-d-discrete-codifferential)): Graph-based differential operators
- **Hodge Laplacians** $\Delta_0$, $\Delta_1$ ([](#def-d-discrete-hodge-laplacians)): Discrete analogs of continuum operators
- **Continuum limit conjecture** ([](#conj-continuum-limit-laplacian)): $\Delta_0$ may converge to d'Alembertian $\Box_g$ as $N \to \infty$, $\Delta t \to 0$

**Field theory** (Section 7):
- **Retarded propagator** $G(v, v')$ ([](#def-d-retarded-green-operator)): Green's function on CST, causal and well-defined
- **Interaction vertices** $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}$ ([](#def-d-interaction-vertex)): Functionals on IG edges/cliques
- **Feynman diagrams** ([](#def-p-diagrammatics)): Correlation functions $\langle \phi(v_1) \cdots \phi(v_k) \rangle$ as sums over graphs

### 9.2. The necessity and sufficiency of $(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{G})$

**Necessity**: Why both CST and IG are needed:

| Component | Role | Without it | With it |
|:----------|:-----|:-----------|:--------|
| **CST** $\mathcal{T}$ | Causality, time evolution | No propagators, no retardation | Free field theory |
| **IG** $\mathcal{G}$ | Interactions, entanglement | No vertices, no coupling | Interacting field theory |

**Sufficiency**: What $\mathcal{F}$ provides:

1. **Causal structure**: From $\mathcal{T}$ (partial order $\prec$, faithful embedding)
2. **Metric information**: From $\mathcal{T}$ (interval cardinalities, dimension recovery)
3. **Propagators**: From $\mathcal{T}$ (retarded Green's function $G$)
4. **Interaction vertices**: From $\mathcal{G}$ (coupling strengths $w_{ij}$)
5. **Conservation laws**: From population regulation + $\mathcal{F}$ connectivity
6. **Information redistribution**: From graph connectivity (Proposition [](#prop-info-propagation))

**Conclusion**: The Fractal Set $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{T} \cup \mathcal{G}$ is the **minimal sufficient structure** for a causal, locally interacting, temporally covariant field theory emerging from algorithmic dynamics.

### 9.3. Connections to later chapters

The Fractal Set is the **foundation** for subsequent theoretical developments:

- **[Chapter 9](09_yang_mills.md) (Yang-Mills)**: Plaquettes (Appendix B) provide gauge field holonomies; IG edges define Wilson loops; continuum limit recovers Yang-Mills action
- **Chapter 10 (Holography)**: IG connectivity encodes entanglement; CST + IG → AdS/CFT-like bulk reconstruction
- **Chapter 11 (Quantum corrections)**: Discrete Feynman diagrams (Proposition [](#def-p-diagrammatics)) provide non-perturbative regularization; loop corrections computed on $\mathcal{F}$

**The Fractal Set as a dictionary**: All continuum concepts (fields, propagators, vertices, action, path integral) have **discrete realizations** on $\mathcal{F}$:

| Continuum (QFT) | Discrete (Fractal Set) | Section |
|:----------------|:-----------------------|:--------|
| Spacetime manifold $(M, g)$ | CST $(\mathcal{E}, \prec, \Phi)$ | 2 |
| Causal structure $J^{\pm}$ | Partial order $\prec$ | 2.3 |
| Volume measure ${\rm dVol}_g$ | Episode counts $N(A)$ | 2.3 |
| Fields $\phi(x)$ | 0-cochains $\phi(v)$ | 6 |
| Green's function $G_{\text{ret}}(x, y)$ | Propagator $G(v, v')$ | 7.1 |
| Interaction Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ | Vertex functional $\mathsf{V}_{\mathcal{G}}$ | 7.2 |
| Path integral $\int D\phi \, e^{-S[\phi]}$ | Sum over graphs $\sum_\Gamma W_\Gamma \prod G \prod V$ | 7.3 |
| Unitarity $\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1$ | Information conservation (Thm 4.2) | 4.2 |

### 9.4. Open questions and future work

**Theoretical**:
1. **Optimal sprinkling density**: What is the minimum $\rho$ required for faithful $(M, g)$ recovery? Does it depend on curvature?
2. **Quantum corrections**: How do $O(\hbar)$ corrections modify $\mathcal{F}$? Does the discrete structure survive quantization?
3. **Fermions**: Can spinor fields be naturally defined on $\mathcal{F}$? (Requires extending to bundle-valued cochains)
4. **Non-abelian gauge theory**: Rigorous continuum limit of plaquette action (Appendix B) → Yang-Mills?

**Computational**:
5. **Efficient algorithms**: Current IG construction is $O(N^2)$ (all pairs). Can order-invariant criteria reduce to $O(N \log N)$?
6. **Large-scale simulations**: Scaling to $N \sim 10^6$ episodes, $\rho \sim 10^{10}$ (Planck-scale densification)?

**Physical**:
7. **Observable predictions**: If nature uses Fractal Set structure, what are experimental signatures? Discreteness at Planck scale? Lorentz violation?
8. **Cosmology**: Can $\mathcal{F}$ provide a discrete model of early universe? Connection to causal dynamical triangulations?

**Summary**. The Fractal Set $\mathcal{F}$ is not merely a mathematical abstraction but a **physical hypothesis**: spacetime and interactions emerge from an algorithmic process that can be interrogated, simulated, and falsified. The rigorous theorems of this chapter establish $\mathcal{F}$ as a viable candidate for a **discrete foundation of relativistic field theory**.

## 9.5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

:::{admonition} FAQ: Understanding the Fractal Set
:class: dropdown

**Q1: Why is the CST a *tree* and not a general directed graph?**

**A:** The CST is a tree because each episode has exactly **one parent** (the episode it was cloned from, or the initial root). This reflects the deterministic nature of the cloning operation: when walker $i$ clones at time $t$, the child episode begins at the death location of episode $i$. There is no merging or multiple parentage. Mathematically, this ensures the CST is acyclic and locally finite (each node has finite in-degree and out-degree).

---

**Q2: How does the Fractal Set differ from causal sets (CST in the Sorkin sense)?**

**A:** While both are discrete causal structures, there are key differences:
- **Causal sets** (Bombelli et al. 1987): Random sprinkling of events on spacetime, with causal order inherited from the continuum. No dynamics—the structure is static.
- **Fractal Set**: CST + IG emerges from *algorithmic dynamics* (birth-death-cloning). The CST encodes genealogy (who came from whom), while the IG encodes interactions (who influenced whom). The Fractal Set has **two types of edges** (timelike CST, spacelike IG), enabling richer physics (gauge fields, holography).

**Key advantage**: The Fractal Set is **algorithmically constructible** from a single simulation run, making it directly testable.

---

**Q3: Why does the IG need unbounded valency? Isn't this computationally expensive?**

**A:** Unbounded valency (each episode can connect to arbitrarily many others) naturally arises from the algorithmic coupling mechanism. In the cloning phase, a single walker can influence multiple other walkers' survival decisions simultaneously through the fitness landscape and algorithmic distances. Artificially restricting to $k$ nearest neighbors would break the natural coupling structure emerging from the mean-field interactions.

**Computational workaround**: In practice, the IG edge weights decay rapidly with distance (Definition [](#def-d-ig-edge-weights)), so we can truncate edges below a threshold without loss of accuracy. This reduces the effective complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$ or better.

---

**Q4: How do you ensure temporal symmetry when the algorithm runs in coordinate time $t$?**

**A:** The key insight is **algorithmic construction** from coordinate-independent data:
1. The CST causal order $\prec$ emerges from cloning genealogy (parent-child relationships)
2. The IG coupling arises from selection decisions based on relative fitness comparisons

While the *simulation* runs using discrete timesteps $t = n\Delta t$, the *graph structures* (CST + IG) are defined from discrete algorithmic events (cloning decisions, genealogy) without direct dependence on the specific time discretization. The key property is **exchangeability** of walkers (Axiom [](#def-ax-covariance)), which enables mean-field convergence as $N \to \infty$ ([Chapter 6](06_propagation_chaos.md)).

**Analogy**: It's like Monte Carlo integration—the algorithm samples at specific points, but the estimator converges to the true integral independent of the specific sampling scheme.

---

**Q5: What happens if the EG population explodes (doesn't satisfy Axiom [](#def-ax-local-finiteness))?**

**A:** If the cloning rate exceeds the death rate everywhere, the population grows exponentially and the CST becomes infinite in finite time (explosion). This violates local finiteness (Axiom [](#def-ax-local-finiteness)).

**Solution**: The **population regulation mechanism** (Axiom [](#def-ax-population-regulation)) maintains bounded population through the cloning mechanism. In the Euclidean Gas, the fixed population size $N$ automatically prevents explosion. See [Chapter 3](03_cloning.md) for details on how cloning maintains population balance.

**Physical interpretation**: Explosion corresponds to runaway growth in physical systems. The population regulation is analogous to renormalization in QFT—it regularizes infinities.

---

**Q6: Can the Fractal Set represent quantum fields, or only classical fields?**

**A:** The current framework (Chapter 8) provides a **discrete graph structure** that captures mean-field dynamics. The connection to classical field theory is conjectural. However:
- Section 7.3 (Proposition [](#def-p-diagrammatics)) shows that Feynman diagrams arise naturally from graph sums over $\mathcal{F}$
- The projection maps $\Pi_\varepsilon : \mathcal{F} \to C^\infty(M)$ (Definition [](#def-d-projection-maps)) provide continuum limits
- [Chapter 9](09_yang_mills.md) extends this to gauge theories

**Quantum extension**: To represent quantum fields, we need to:
1. Replace scalar functions $\phi(e)$ with operators $\hat{\phi}(e)$ on a Hilbert space
2. Define a discrete analogue of the canonical commutation relations
3. Prove the continuum limit recovers standard QFT

This is **open research** (see Section 9.4, Question 2).

---

**Q7: How do I implement the Fractal Set in code? Do I need to store the entire CST + IG?**

**A:** **Minimal storage**: You only need to log:
- Episode birth/death times: $t^{\rm b}_e, t^{\rm d}_e$
- Parent IDs: $\text{parent}(e)$
- Proper lifetimes: $\tau_e$ (or compute on-the-fly from trajectory data)

The CST can be reconstructed from the parent IDs (it's a tree). The IG can be computed on-demand from the selection coupling criterion (Definition [](#def-d-information-graph)).

**Example (pseudocode)**:
```python
class Episode:
    def __init__(self, id, parent_id, t_birth, t_death, tau):
        self.id = id
        self.parent = parent_id
        self.t_b = t_birth
        self.t_d = t_death
        self.tau = tau  # proper lifetime

# Log episodes during simulation
episodes = []  # List of Episode objects

# Reconstruct CST post-hoc
def build_cst(episodes):
    cst = nx.DiGraph()
    for e in episodes:
        cst.add_node(e.id)
        if e.parent is not None:
            cst.add_edge(e.parent, e.id, weight=e.tau)
    return cst

# Compute IG edges (selection coupling)
def build_ig(episodes, selection_events):
    ig = nx.Graph()
    for t, alive_set in selection_events.items():
        # Create clique among all alive episodes at time t
        for i in alive_set:
            for j in alive_set:
                if i < j:  # avoid duplicate edges
                    ig.add_edge(i, j, weight=compute_weight(i, j, t))
    return ig
```

---

**Q8: What is the computational complexity of constructing $\mathcal{F}$ for $N$ episodes over time $T$?**

**A:**
- **CST construction**: $O(N)$ (linear scan of parent IDs)
- **IG construction** (naive, all-pairs selection coupling): $O(K N^2)$ where $K = T / \Delta t$ is the number of selection events
- **IG construction** (optimized, truncated edges): $O(N \log N)$ using spatial hashing or k-d trees to find nearby episodes

**Memory**: $O(N)$ for CST, $O(N \cdot d_{\text{avg}})$ for IG where $d_{\text{avg}}$ is the average degree.

---

**Q9: How does the continuum limit $\rho \to \infty$ work? Do we recover smooth spacetime?**

**A:** This is a conjectural limit that remains to be proven. The idea is that as $N \to \infty$ and $\Delta t \to 0$ (with appropriate scaling), the discrete CST nodes become increasingly dense in spacetime, and discrete fields $\phi(v)$ may converge to smooth solutions of continuum equations like:

$$
\Box_g \phi + V'(\phi) = 0.
$$

**Challenge**: Proving such convergence requires:
1. Characterizing the limiting distribution of CST nodes in spacetime
2. Showing discrete operators (like $\Delta_0$) converge to continuum operators (like $\Box_g$)
3. Controlling approximation errors and boundary effects

**Key open question**: Does the discrete algorithmic construction naturally produce the "right" continuum limit, or do additional constraints need to be imposed?

---

**Q10: Is the Fractal Set framework testable? How would we distinguish it from standard QFT?**

**A:** **Yes**, the framework makes testable predictions:
1. **Discrete spacetime**: If nature uses Fractal Set structure, there should be departures from temporal symmetry at ultra-high energies (Planck scale). Experiments: cosmic ray observations, gamma-ray bursts.
2. **Non-local interactions**: The unbounded IG valency predicts non-local entanglement patterns that differ from local QFT. Experiments: Bell tests, quantum teleportation with macroscopic separations.
3. **Algorithmic signatures**: If spacetime emerges from a birth-death process, there may be statistical signatures (e.g., episode lifetime distributions) observable in cosmological data.

**Current status**: These are **speculative**—no experimental anomaly currently demands a Fractal Set explanation. But the framework is *falsifiable* (unlike some quantum gravity approaches), which is a key virtue.

# **Appendix B: Plaquettes and Fundamental Cycles**

This appendix extends the fractal set framework with the notion of **plaquettes**—closed loops formed by combining CST and IG edges—which provide the geometric foundation for gauge theories and discrete field theories on $\mathcal F$.

## B.1. Graph-Theoretic Foundation

**Setup**: Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the set of episodes. The CST is $T = (\mathcal{E}, \to)$ where $e \to e'$ indicates causal parenthood. The IG is $G = (\mathcal{E}, \sim)$ where $e \sim e'$ indicates temporal overlap or interaction. Define the augmented edge set:

$$
\mathcal{E}^{\Rightarrow} = \{e \to e' : \text{CST edges}\} \cup \{\overrightarrow{ee'} : \text{oriented IG edges}\}
$$

**Key fact**: CST is a spanning tree (acyclic, connected). Therefore it has exactly $|\mathcal{E}| - 1$ edges if the graph is connected.

## B.2. Fundamental Cycles

:::{prf:definition} Fundamental Cycles
:label: def-d-fundamental-cycles

For each IG edge $e \sim e'$, there exists a unique path $\pi_T(e, e')$ in the CST connecting $e$ and $e'$. The **fundamental cycle** associated with this IG edge is:

$$
C(e, e') = (e \sim e') \cup \pi_T(e, e')
$$

This is a closed loop: starting at $e$, traversing the IG edge to $e'$, then following the CST path back to $e$.
:::

:::{prf:proposition} Cycle Basis
:label: prop-cycle-basis

The fundamental cycles $\{C(e, e') : e \sim e' \in G \setminus T\}$ form a basis for the cycle space. Every cycle in the full graph $T \cup G$ can be written as a sum (symmetric difference) of fundamental cycles.
:::

*Proof sketch*: Standard result from algebraic graph theory. The number of fundamental cycles equals $|E_G| - |\mathcal{E}| + 1$ where $E_G$ is the total number of edges. □

## B.3. Plaquette Definition

:::{prf:definition} Plaquettes
:label: def-d-plaquettes

The **plaquettes** of the CST/IG structure are the fundamental cycles $C(e, e')$. We denote the set of all plaquettes by $\mathcal{P}$.

Each plaquette has:
- A **boundary** $\partial p = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k\}$ (ordered sequence of episodes)
- An **orientation** induced by orienting the IG edge consistently
- A **spatial embedding** via the position embeddings $\Phi(e_i) : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{X}$ (death positions in configuration space)
:::

## B.4. Discrete Weights

Each plaquette can be assigned a weight based on the discrete graph structure:

:::{prf:definition} Plaquette Weight
:label: def-d-plaquette-weight

For plaquette $p$ with boundary episodes $\{e_1, \ldots, e_k\}$, define the **plaquette weight** as:

$$
w(p) = \sum_{i=1}^k \tau_{e_i} \cdot d_{\text{alg}}(e_i, e_{i+1})
$$

where:
- $\tau_{e_i} = t^{\rm d}_{e_i} - t^{\rm b}_{e_i}$ is the episode duration
- $d_{\text{alg}}(e_i, e_{i+1})$ is the algorithmic distance between adjacent episodes in the cycle
- The sum runs over all edges in the boundary $\partial p$

**Alternative**: For configuration space visualization, use the enclosed area in $\mathcal{X}$:

$$
A_{\mathcal{X}}(p) = \frac{1}{2}\left|\sum_{i=1}^k (x_i \times x_{i+1})\right|
$$

where $x_i = \Phi(e_i)$ are the death positions projected to configuration space.
:::

**Remark**: These plaquette definitions provide canonical closed loops in the Fractal Set. The weights $w(p)$ can be used for:
1. **Graph-based field theory**: Assigning action contributions to cycles
2. **Information flow analysis**: Quantifying feedback loops in the IG
3. **Topological invariants**: Computing homology groups of $\mathcal{F}$

Speculative connection to gauge theory ([Chapter 9](09_yang_mills.md)) requires extending episodes with internal color charges, which do not currently exist in the framework.
