### D.1 Computational Complexity & Scalability

(sec-appendix-d-the-metric-inversion-problem)=
#### D.1.1 The $O(D^3)$ Metric Inversion Problem

**Objection:** *The Riemannian metric $G(z)$ requires inverting a dense mass matrix for natural gradient updates. With latent dimension $D \sim 10^3$, this $O(D^3)$ operation is prohibitive per step.*

**Response:**

1. **Manifold separation.** The metric $G$ operates on the **state manifold** $\mathcal{Z}$ (typically $D \approx 10^2$), not the parameter manifold $\Theta$ ($D \approx 10^9$). Inverting a $256 \times 256$ matrix on GPU costs microseconds—negligible compared to the forward pass. See {ref}`Section 2.5 <sec-second-order-sensitivity-value-defines-a-local-metric>` and {ref}`Section 2.6 <sec-the-metric-hierarchy-fixing-the-category-error>` for the distinction between state-space and parameter-space geometry.

2. **Structured approximations.** For larger latent spaces ($D > 1024$), we use Kronecker-factorized (K-FAC) or block-diagonal curvature approximations, reducing complexity to $O(D)$ or $O(D^{1.5})$.

3. **Amortized updates.** The metric is a slowly varying field. We update the curvature estimate on a slower timescale than the policy (analogous to target network updates in DQN), avoiding per-step recomputation. See {ref}`Section 9.10 <sec-differential-geometry-view-curvature-as-conditioning>` for the runtime trust-region regulator.

(sec-appendix-d-the-pde-solver-overhead)=
#### D.1.2 The PDE Solver Overhead

**Objection:** *The Critic solves the Screened Poisson (Helmholtz) equation. Solving PDEs on high-dimensional manifolds is intractable. Are you running a finite-element solver inside the training loop?*

**Response:**

No. We use the **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** paradigm: the neural network *is* the solver.

1. **Variational primal.** The Critic $V_\theta(z)$ is a function approximator for the PDE solution. We do not discretize the manifold.

2. **Loss, not loop.** The Helmholtz equation appears as a **regularization term** in the loss:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{critic}} = \|\text{TD-Error}\|^2 + \lambda_{\text{PDE}} \| -\Delta_G V + \kappa^2 V - \rho_r \|^2.
   $$
   The network learns to satisfy the PDE via standard gradient descent—an optimization problem, not an integration problem. See Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-the-hjb-helmholtz-correspondence` and {ref}`Section 24.2 <sec-the-bulk-potential-screened-poisson-equation>`.

3. **Implicit Green's function.** Training on temporal TD-error teaches the network the Green's function of the operator without explicitly inverting the Laplacian.

(sec-appendix-d-real-time-latency)=
#### D.1.3 Real-Time Latency (The 29 Checks)

**Objection:** *Evaluating 29 diagnostic nodes per step—some involving Jacobian spectral norms or counterfactual rollouts—creates unacceptable latency for millisecond-scale robotics or trading.*

**Response:**

The Sieve uses an **asynchronous tiered architecture** ({ref}`Section 7.4 <sec-implementation-tiers>`).

1. **Fast path (Tier 1).** Production inference runs $O(1)$ lightweight checks (Saturation, Bounds, Zeno) fused into the main CUDA kernel. Latency overhead: near zero.

2. **Slow path (Tier 4).** Heavy diagnostics (Jacobian spectral norms, counterfactual rollouts) run **asynchronously** on a separate monitor thread or GPU.

3. **Circuit-breaker pattern.** If the asynchronous Monitor detects a Tier 4 violation, it sends an interrupt to the Policy. The system is **eventually consistent** with the Sieve, not synchronously blocked by it. See {ref}`Sections 3–6 <sec-diagnostics-stability-checks>` for the full node catalog.

(sec-appendix-d-distributed-training-synchronization)=
#### D.1.4 Distributed Training Synchronization

**Objection:** *Standard data parallelism relies on gradient averaging. Your adaptive multipliers $\lambda_i$ and global metrics couple the batch, breaking efficient scaling.*

**Response:**

The **Universal Governor** ({ref}`Section 3.5 <sec-adaptive-multipliers-learned-penalties-setpoints-and-calibration>`) decouples local gradients from global dynamics.

1. **Telemetry aggregation.** Sieve metrics (codebook entropy, representation drift) are batch statistics requiring a single `AllReduce`—standard in BatchNorm and distributed training.

2. **Slow-control hypothesis.** The multipliers $\lambda_i$ evolve on a slower timescale than the weights. The Governor broadcasts scalars (learning rates, penalties) to all workers—negligible overhead compared to gradient communication.

3. **Local constraints.** Most checks (BarrierSat, BoundaryCheck) are trajectory-local. They enforce per-sample on each GPU without global synchronization, allowing near-linear scaling.

(sec-appendix-d-optimization-dynamics-convergence)=
### D.2 Optimization Dynamics & Convergence

(sec-appendix-d-multi-objective-gradient-fighting)=
#### D.2.1 Multi-Objective Gradient Fighting

**Objection:** *With dozens of loss terms (task, 29 constraints, entropy, consistency), gradient interference will produce Pareto-suboptimal deadlocks or oscillatory instability.*

**Response:**

Optimization is treated as a **Stackelberg game**, not scalar minimization.

1. **Gradient orthogonalization.** We apply **Projected Conflicting Gradients (PCGrad)**: if $\nabla \mathcal{L}_{\text{constraint}}$ conflicts with $\nabla \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ (negative cosine similarity), the task gradient is projected onto the constraint's normal plane. Safety never trades off against task progress.

2. **Adaptive Lagrangian multipliers.** The $\lambda_i$ are Lagrange multipliers updated via dual ascent ({ref}`Section 3.5 <sec-adaptive-multipliers-learned-penalties-setpoints-and-calibration>`). Satisfied constraints have $\lambda_i \to 0$, removing their gradient contribution. The Governor "turns off" passing checks.

3. **Priority hierarchy.** Hard constraints (BarrierLock) clamp gradients; soft constraints (BarrierGap) apply forces; task loss applies only in the feasible region. This hierarchy prevents deadlock by construction.

(sec-appendix-d-timescale-decoupling-instability)=
#### D.2.2 Timescale Decoupling Instability

**Objection:** *The hierarchy $\delta \ll \gamma \ll \alpha$ is hard to enforce. If the World Model drifts faster than the Critic adapts, BarrierTypeII logic halts the policy, producing stop-and-go dynamics.*

**Response:**

We use **Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation (TTSA)** theory.

1. **Spectral regulation.** Timescales are enforced via **Spectral Normalization** with distinct coefficients for World Model ($S$) and Critic ($V$). Bounding the Lipschitz constant of $S$ more tightly than $V$ mathematically guarantees the TTSA convergence condition $\eta_{\text{slow}}/\eta_{\text{fast}} \to 0$. See {ref}`Section 3.2 <sec-scaling-exponents-characterizing-the-agent>`.

2. **Hysteresis, not oscillation.** Stop-and-go is **intentional hysteresis**. The Governor implements Schmitt-trigger logic: updates pause at $\epsilon_{\text{high}}$ and resume at $\epsilon_{\text{low}}$. This prevents chattering and ensures the Policy updates only against a converged Value landscape.

3. **Polyak averaging.** The Critic used for Policy updates is an EMA target, low-pass filtering high-frequency drift.

(sec-appendix-d-the-moving-target-of-the-manifold)=
#### D.2.3 The Moving Target of the Manifold

**Objection:** *The metric $G$ depends on $V$, but $V$ is being learned. The geometry is non-stationary. How can geodesic optimization converge if the ground keeps shifting?*

**Response:**

We model this as a **Self-Consistent Field (SCF)** problem.

1. **Adiabatic approximation.** If the metric update rate is slower than the policy update rate (enforced by the Governor), the agent perceives locally static geometry. It solves for the "instantaneous geodesic" at step $t$.

2. **Trust-region iteration.** We fix $G$ for an epoch, optimize the Policy against $G_t$, then update $V_{t+1}$ to generate $G_{t+1}$. This discrete iteration converges to a fixed point if the mapping is contractive—ensured by the **Conformal Coupling** damping term $\Omega$ ({ref}`Section 24.4 <sec-geometric-back-reaction-the-conformal-coupling>`).

3. **Curvature-adaptive step size.** High-curvature regions (large $\|\nabla^2 V\|$) increase the effective mass, automatically reducing the step size where the metric changes most rapidly.

(sec-appendix-d-discrete-bottleneck-collapse)=
#### D.2.4 Discrete Bottleneck Collapse

**Objection:** *VQ-VAEs suffer codebook collapse: the model ignores the discrete latent and relies on the decoder. If $K$ collapses, Causal Enclosure breaks. Is the Anti-Collapse loss sufficient?*

**Response:**

We enforce **Information-Theoretic Liveness**, not just a loss term.

1. **Codebook resetting (Lazarus Protocol).** If a code $k$ has usage frequency below threshold $\epsilon$ for window $W$, it is hard-reset to a random encoder output from the current batch. This guarantees 100% codebook utilization. See {ref}`Section 3.3 <sec-defect-functionals-implementing-regulation>`.

2. **Entropy monitoring.** Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-information-stability-window-operational` requires $H(K) \approx \log |\mathcal{K}|$. If entropy drops (collapse), **ScaleCheck (Node 4)** fails. The Governor increases the commitment loss $\beta$ and injects encoder noise until entropy is restored.

3. **Geometric separation.** We apply **VICReg** regularization on embeddings *before* quantization, forcing the continuous space to span the full codebook. See {ref}`Section 2.2b <sec-the-shutter-as-a-vq-vae>`.

(sec-appendix-d-information-theory-representation)=
### D.3 Information Theory & Representation

(sec-appendix-d-the-definition-of-texture)=
#### D.3.1 The Definition of "Texture"

**Objection:** *You define $z_{\mathrm{tex}}$ as non-causal residue. But in POMDPs, "noise" often contains signal (radio static warning of storms). Forcing $\partial \pi / \partial z_{\mathrm{tex}} = 0$ guarantees blindness.*

**Response:**

The split between texture and structure is **learned**, not manual.

1. **Information bottleneck test.** The encoder optimizes:

   $$
   \min I(X_t; Z_{\text{tex}}) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad I(Z_n, K; X_{t+1}) \approx I(X_t; X_{t+1}).
   $$
   If "noise" predicts the future, the encoder **must** promote it to $z_n$ or $K$ to satisfy the prediction objective. See {ref}`Section 2.2b <sec-the-shutter-as-a-vq-vae>` and {ref}`Section 2.8 <sec-conditional-independence-and-sufficiency>`.

2. **Texture as residual.** $z_{\mathrm{tex}} := X_t - \text{Decoder}(K, z_n)$. If the residual contains critical information, prediction error rises, and gradient pressure moves that information into the structural state.

3. **Firewall as validity check.** The constraint $\partial \pi / \partial z_{\mathrm{tex}} = 0$ is a **safety assert**: "Do not hallucinate patterns in the residual." If the policy *needs* the residual, **Node 29 (TextureFirewallCheck)** fails, signaling that representation capacity must increase.

(sec-appendix-d-symbolic-grounding-and-the-bit-rate-gap)=
#### D.3.2 Symbolic Grounding and the Bit-Rate Gap

**Objection:** *Continuous control requires infinite precision (contact forces). Can a discrete $K$ capture the nuance, or are you quantizing away control authority?*

**Response:**

The state is **hybrid** $(K, z_n)$, not purely symbolic.

1. **Atlas architecture.** $K$ (macro) selects the **mode** or **chart** (e.g., "In Contact," "Free Space"). $z_n$ (nuisance) encodes **continuous coordinates** within that chart (exact force, position). See {ref}`Section 7.8 <sec-tier-the-attentive-atlas>`.

2. **Control authority preserved.** The policy $\pi(a|K, z_n)$ has access to high-precision $z_n$. The discrete bottleneck restricts **decision topology** (switching strategies), not **execution precision** (applying torque).

3. **Bits index geometry.** High-fidelity interaction relies on geometry ($z_n$, floating point). Logic relies on bits ($K$). We use bits to index geometry, not replace it.

(sec-appendix-d-measure-concentration-in-high-dimensions)=
#### D.3.3 Measure Concentration in High Dimensions

**Objection:** *In high-dimensional spaces, distances concentrate and curvature becomes unintuitive. Does the metric $G$ retain meaning in $\mathbb{R}^{512}$?*

**Response:**

We combat concentration via the **Manifold Hypothesis** and **Conformal Scaling**.

1. **Low intrinsic dimension.** Data lies on a manifold of intrinsic dimension $d \ll 512$. **Node 6 (Fractal Dimension Check)** monitors this. The metric $G$ operates on the tangent bundle of this manifold.

2. **Anisotropic distance.** The Mahalanobis distance induced by $G(z)$ rescales directions by relevance (Value sensitivity). Irrelevant directions have low weight; relevant directions are stretched—a "soft dimensionality reduction." See {ref}`Section 20 <sec-wasserstein-fisher-rao-geometry-unified-transport-on-hybrid-state-spaces>`.

3. **Risk-based units.** The conformal factor $\Omega = 1 + \alpha\|\nabla^2 V\|$ ({ref}`Section 24.4 <sec-geometric-back-reaction-the-conformal-coupling>`) measures distance in **risk units**. Risk does not concentrate uniformly—dangerous states remain far from safe ones in this metric.

(sec-appendix-d-physics-geometry-isomorphisms)=
### D.4 Physics & Geometry Isomorphisms

(sec-appendix-d-the-validity-of-the-hjb-helmholtz-map)=
#### D.4.1 The Validity of the HJB-Helmholtz Map

**Objection:** *The Bellman-to-Screened-Poisson map holds for diffusions. Does it break for jump-diffusions or non-Markovian dynamics?*

**Response:**

The map generalizes to any Markov generator.

1. **Operator universality.** The Bellman equation is $\mathcal{L}V - \alpha V + r = 0$. For Brownian motion, $\mathcal{L} = \Delta$. For jump-diffusion, $\mathcal{L}$ includes a Lévy integro-differential term. The "screened Poisson" form $(-\mathcal{L} + \kappa^2)V = \rho$ is the resolvent of any generator.

2. **Critic as resolvent.** The Critic approximates the resolvent operator $R_\alpha = (\alpha I - \mathcal{L})^{-1}$, well-defined for any Feller process. See {ref}`Section 24.2 <sec-the-bulk-potential-screened-poisson-equation>`.

3. **WFR handles jumps.** In the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry ({ref}`Section 20 <sec-wasserstein-fisher-rao-geometry-unified-transport-on-hybrid-state-spaces>`), jumps are "reaction" terms (teleportation) rather than "transport" terms, preserving geometric interpretation.

(sec-appendix-d-thermodynamic-metaphors-vs-reality)=
#### D.4.2 Thermodynamic Metaphors vs. Reality

**Objection:** *You invoke "Free Energy" and "Temperature." In physics, these have precise microphysical meaning. In AI, isn't this just poetic language for regularization?*

**Response:**

We claim a **structural isomorphism** via Large Deviation Theory, not microphysical identity.

1. **Sanov's theorem.** The probability of a rare trajectory decays as $P \sim \exp(-I(x))$, where $I(x)$ is the rate function. In thermodynamics, the rate function is Free Energy; in RL, it is the Value function (log-probability of optimality).

2. **Gibbs measure.** The optimal policy under entropy regularization is exactly Boltzmann: $\pi(a|s) \propto \exp(Q(s,a)/\alpha)$. This is not metaphor—it is the unique solution to MaxEnt control. See {ref}`Section 21.2 <sec-policy-control-field>`.

3. **Operational heat bath.** "Temperature" $T_c$ is the exploration noise level. The "heat bath" is the source of stochasticity (SGD noise, epsilon-greedy RNG). Thermodynamic quantities (heat capacity, entropy production) are rigorously derivable.

(sec-appendix-d-gauge-invariance-in-neural-networks)=
#### D.4.3 Gauge Invariance in Neural Networks

**Objection:** *Neural networks learn to break symmetries to fit data. Enforcing strict invariance (e.g., $SE(3)$) reduces expressivity. Why prefer hard invariance over soft augmentation?*

**Response:**

We enforce invariance for **sample efficiency** and **safety**, not expressivity.

1. **The augmentation tax.** Learning symmetries from data requires $O(|G|)$ more samples. For $SE(3)$, this is prohibitive. Baking in the symmetry reduces the hypothesis space to physically valid models. See {ref}`Section 1.1.4 <sec-symmetries-and-gauge-freedoms>` and {ref}`Section 3.3.A <sec-a-vq-vae-regulation>`.

2. **Distribution-shift robustness.** A model that "learns" rotation invariance may fail if rotated 45° outside its training distribution. Strict invariance guarantees consistent behavior across the entire orbit.

3. **Quotient manifolds.** Enforcing invariance trains on the quotient $\mathcal{X}/G$, which has lower dimension and simpler topology—an easier optimization problem.

(sec-appendix-d-the-wfr-metric-justification)=
#### D.4.4 The WFR Metric Justification

**Objection:** *Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao is mathematically obscure. Why not simpler Wasserstein-2 or pure Fisher-Rao?*

**Response:**

WFR is the **unique** metric handling the lifecycle of hypotheses: creation, movement, destruction.

1. **Wasserstein-2 failure.** $W_2$ models transport (shifting belief). It fails when probability must "teleport" between disconnected modes—$W_2$ would drag mass through walls. WFR allows tunneling via the reaction term.

2. **Fisher-Rao failure.** Fisher-Rao models reweighting but ignores geometric similarity. It treats $x=1$ and $x=1.001$ as categorically distinct.

3. **Hybrid necessity.** Agents must both track objects (transport) and switch hypotheses (reaction). WFR unifies these via the length scale $\lambda$. We use the **Cone Space approximation** for tractable computation. See {ref}`Section 20 <sec-wasserstein-fisher-rao-geometry-unified-transport-on-hybrid-state-spaces>`.

(sec-appendix-d-control-theory-system-safety)=
### D.5 Control Theory & System Safety

(sec-appendix-d-the-constitution-vs-the-bitter-lesson)=
#### D.5.1 The "Constitution" vs. The "Bitter Lesson"

**Objection:** *Sutton's Bitter Lesson says general methods that scale beat hand-engineered priors. The Sieve is massive hand-engineering. Won't a raw Transformer eventually outperform it?*

**Response:**

The Bitter Lesson applies to search and learning, not specification and verification.

1. **Constraint vs. policy.** We hand-engineer **constraints** (what is safe), not the **policy** (how to act). An unconstrained Transformer that minimizes prediction error might delete safety logs to simplify the world. The Sieve renders such policies unrepresentable. See {ref}`Sections 3–6 <sec-diagnostics-stability-checks>`.

2. **Sample efficiency.** Unconstrained models require $10^{13}$ tokens to learn object permanence. Geometric priors (symplectic integrators, equivariant architectures) reduce the hypothesis space to physically plausible worlds, improving sample efficiency by orders of magnitude.

3. **Alignment ceiling.** Scaling improves competence, not alignment. A superintelligent unconstrained agent is a more efficient maximizer of a flawed proxy. The Sieve provides **runtime alignment** via structural constraints that cannot be learned away.

(sec-appendix-d-stability-proofs-for-learned-controllers)=
#### D.5.2 Stability Proofs for Learned Controllers

**Objection:** *You invoke Lyapunov stability, but $V$ is a neural network with approximation error. How can a learned certifier prove stability?*

**Response:**

We rely on **runtime monitoring** and **contraction metrics**, not static verification.

1. **Forward invariance via monitoring.** We do not prove $\dot{V}(z) < 0$ offline (undecidable). We enforce it **online**: if $\dot{V}_{\text{observed}} > 0$, **Node 7 (Barrier Breach)** triggers Safe Mode before stability is lost.

2. **Lipschitz enforcement.** Stability proofs assume Lipschitz continuity. **Node 20 (LipschitzCheck)** monitors weight spectral norms. Violations cause the Governor to clamp weights, forcing the network into the regime where proofs hold.

3. **Correct-by-construction updates.** Updates are **Mirror Descent** in the dual space of constraints. Optimization theory guarantees projected gradient descent stays in the feasible (stable) region for sufficiently small step sizes (managed by the Governor).

(sec-appendix-d-the-frame-problem-in-causal-sets)=
#### D.5.3 The Frame Problem in Causal Sets

**Objection:** *If the agent builds spacetime via interaction, how is object permanence maintained? If the agent stops interacting with a region, does it cease to exist?*

**Response:**

We solve this via **Holographic Persistence** and the **Causal Memory Cone**.

1. **Past light cone.** "Existence" is defined by the causal set $J^-(e_t)$: all events that could affect the present. Past interactions remain in causal history even if current interaction stops.

2. **World Model as propagator.** The World Model $\bar{P}$ predicts the future light cone. Unobserved objects evolve via internal dynamics ($S_t$). Object permanence is the inertia of latent state $z$ in the absence of boundary updates (Dreaming Mode). See {ref}`Section 20.5 <sec-connection-to-gksl-master-equation>`.

3. **Forgetfulness horizon.** Things *do* cease to exist if they cross the information horizon. If an object interacts with nothing for $T > T_{\text{Lyapunov}}$, its state becomes irretrievable. The model correctly treats this as dissolution—bounding required memory.

(sec-appendix-d-adversarial-robustness-of-the-sieve)=
#### D.5.4 Adversarial Robustness of the Sieve

**Objection:** *The Governor minimizes Sieve violations. What stops it from gaming the metrics—forcing the agent to do nothing? A rock is perfectly safe.*

**Response:**

We enforce **Liveness** via ergodicity and thermodynamic cycles.

1. **Mixing constraint.** **Node 10 (ErgoCheck)** requires visiting diverse states ($\tau_{\text{mix}} < \infty$). A frozen agent has $\tau_{\text{mix}} = \infty$, violating the check.

2. **Entropy production.** The agent must maintain a thermodynamic cycle: compression (perception) → expansion (action). Doing nothing produces zero entropy, violating **ThermoCycleCheck (Node 33)**. See {ref}`Section 23 <sec-the-boundary-interface-symplectic-structure>`.

3. **Task reward as drive.** The Governor optimizes a ratio of Task Reward to Safety Violation. The solution to "maximize velocity subject to speed limit" is not "stop"—it is "go at the speed limit."

(sec-appendix-d-falsifiability)=
#### D.5.5 Falsifiability

**Objection:** *This framework can model anything. If the agent fails, you can blame insufficient capacity, improper metric, or bad priors. What outcome would prove it wrong?*

**Response:**

The framework makes specific, counter-intuitive predictions.

1. **Prediction 1: Pitchfork bifurcation.** Learning should exhibit a discrete phase transition at critical temperature $T_c$ where latent symmetry spontaneously breaks ({ref}`Section 21.2 <sec-policy-control-field>`). *Falsification:* If geometry-level diagnostics (e.g., eigen/singular-value spectra of $G$ or latent covariance) show no symmetry-breaking signature or eigenvalue gap where the model predicts one, the symmetry-breaking model is wrong. The scalar loss can still decrease smoothly.

2. **Prediction 2: Texture immunity.** The Texture Firewall (Node 29) decouples high-frequency residuals from control. *Falsification:* Apply an adversarial patch (high-frequency noise) that does not alter the macro-state $K$. If the policy $\pi(a|z)$ changes significantly despite $z_n$ remaining constant, the Firewall is refuted.

3. **Prediction 3: Screening-length decay.** Value propagation decays exponentially with geodesic distance at rate $\kappa = -\ln\gamma / \Delta t$ (Proposition {prf:ref}`prop-green-s-function-decay`, Corollary {prf:ref}`cor-discount-as-screening-length`). *Falsification:* Measure empirical value correlation as a function of latent distance. If decay does not match $\exp(-\kappa \cdot d_G(z, z'))$, the Helmholtz-Bellman correspondence is false.

(sec-appendix-d-philosophical-naming-premise)=
### D.6 The Philosophical and Naming Premise

(sec-appendix-d-the-fragile-branding)=
#### D.6.1 The "Fragile" Branding

**Objection:** *In engineering, "fragility" is usually a liability. Why frame the agent's name around a negative attribute rather than calling it the "Transparent" or "Accountable" agent?*

**Response:**

The name **Fragile** is an intentional portmanteau encoding the four pillars of the framework's philosophy:

1. **FRA (Fractal).** The agent's representation uses **fractal geometry**. The stacked TopoEncoder ({ref}`Section 7.12 <sec-stacked-topoencoders-deep-renormalization-group-flow>`) decomposes signals into a self-similar hierarchy where information-theoretic laws remain scale-invariant from macro-concepts ($K$) to micro-texture ($z_{\text{tex}}$).

2. **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).** This framework targets general-purpose agents, not narrow task-specific algorithms. By defining the fundamental relationships between representation, dynamics, value, and control—via the Metric Law (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-capacity-constrained-metric-law`), the Holographic Interface ({ref}`Section 23 <sec-the-boundary-interface-symplectic-structure>`), and the Causal Information Bound ({ref}`Section 33 <sec-causal-information-bound>`)—the framework provides a unified architecture for agents capable of reasoning under partial observability.

3. **AGILE (Operational Speed & Flexibility).**
   - **Developer Agility:** Designed for the "single-person laboratory"—implementable without massive GPU clusters or industrial-scale compute ({ref}`Section 7 <sec-computational-considerations>`).
   - **Architectural Agility:** Strictly modular. The engineer selects which diagnostic nodes to implement and which metabolic tradeoffs to make ({ref}`Sections 3–6 <sec-diagnostics-stability-checks>`).
   - **Dynamic Agility:** In non-equilibrium environments, rigid agents fail. An agile agent adapts its deliberation time $S^*$ and policy flow to the world's volatility ({ref}`Section 31.3 <sec-optimal-deliberation-the-fast-slow-law>`).

4. **FRAGILE (Fail-Fast Design).**
   - **Learning to be Robust:** The agent starts "thin"—few parameters, sparse latent bundle. Robustness is not given but *earned* by navigating the Sieve.
   - **Fail Loudly:** The most dangerous AI failure is silent. The 60 diagnostic nodes ({ref}`Section 3 <sec-diagnostics-stability-checks>`) ensure constraint violations trigger immediate halts or alerts.
   - **Path to Robustness:** We do not treat the agent as a magical black box with infinite capacity that will inevitably converge. Imperfection and failure are first-class citizens; acknowledging fragility is the only way to ensure behavior remains auditable and predictable, with explicit recovery mechanisms ({ref}`Section 6 <sec-interventions>`).

The name encodes a design philosophy: start with explicit fragility, instrument it completely, and build robustness through verified operation.

(sec-appendix-d-the-degenerate-case-claim)=
#### D.6.2 The "Degenerate Case" Claim

**Objection:** *You claim standard RL is a "degenerate" special case of this framework. Isn't it more likely that this framework is an over-parameterized "epicycle" built on top of simple, effective principles?*

**Response:**

The claim is not rhetorical—it is a precise mathematical statement proven by explicit reduction.

1. **The Degeneracy Theorem.** Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-rl-degeneracy` states that standard RL emerges under the joint limit $G \to I$ (flat geometry), $|\mathcal{K}| \to \infty$ (infinite capacity), $\Xi_{\text{crit}} \to \infty$ (disabled Sieve). This is not "our framework + RL"; it is "our framework, with safety turned off."

2. **30 explicit reductions.** Table 0.6.1 ({ref}`Section 0.6 <sec-standard-rl-as-the-degenerate-limit>`) provides 30 row-by-row correspondences: REINFORCE is natural gradient with $G=I$; Bellman is Helmholtz on a lattice; SAC is MaxEnt control without the state-space metric; RND is ontological stress fed to reward without fission. Each reduction is independently verifiable.

3. **Epicycles vs. emergent structure.** Ptolemaic epicycles were ad-hoc patches to save a flawed model. Here, the "extra" structure (curvature, capacity constraints, WFR geometry) is not added to fix problems—it **emerges** from first principles: capacity constraints yield the Metric Law; the Metric Law yields geodesic dynamics; geodesic dynamics yield natural gradients. The framework is *more parsimonious* at the foundational level; standard RL is what remains when you discard the structure.

4. **Falsifiability.** If standard RL consistently outperformed this framework on tasks requiring safety, stability, or interpretability, the "degenerate" label would be empirically refuted. The burden is on the simpler theory to explain why it works *despite* ignoring coordinate invariance, capacity limits, and causal structure.
5. **Practical complexity of "simple" RL.** Despite theoretical simplicity, modern RL is rarely effective without a large stack of engineering heuristics, heavy tuning, and costly infrastructure, and outcomes are hard to predict or justify from first principles. This paper is famous in the RL community for demonstrating that the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is not primarily due to its "trust region" clipping objective (the theoretical innovation), but rather a collection of "code-level optimizations" or "knobs" that are often omitted or treated as minor details in original papers {cite}`huang2022ppo-implementation-details`. In real-world settings, core assumptions like IID sampling and stationarity routinely fail, further exposing the gap between the "simple" theory and its operational reality.

(sec-appendix-d-the-agency-problem)=
#### D.6.3 The Agency Problem

**Objection:** *If the agent's actions are determined by a PDE solver propagating boundary charges, is there any room for genuine "agency," or is the agent just a sophisticated physical resistor?*

**Response:**

The framework does not eliminate agency—it *geometrizes* it.

1. **The Policy as symmetry-breaking.** At the origin (Semantic Vacuum), the system is $SO(D)$-symmetric: all directions are equally likely. The policy $\pi$ breaks this symmetry by injecting a directional kick ({ref}`Section 21.2 <sec-policy-control-field>`, Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-pitchfork-bifurcation-structure`). This is not passive resistance; it is an active *choice* of direction, analogous to spontaneous magnetization.

2. **The Equations of Motion are not deterministic.** Definition {prf:ref}`def-bulk-drift-continuous-flow` defines a *stochastic* differential equation with diffusion term $\sigma dW$. The PDE (Helmholtz) determines the *expected* value landscape; the agent navigates this landscape under noise. Stochasticity provides the "degrees of freedom" for exploration.

3. **Interventional agency.** The $do$-operator ({ref}`Section 32.1 <sec-the-interventional-operator-as-manifold-surgery>`) performs a topological surgery that severs incoming causal arrows. This is not passive reception of boundary conditions—it is active manipulation of the causal graph. The agent is both a *receiver* (Dirichlet BC) and an *emitter* (Neumann BC) at the interface ({ref}`Section 23 <sec-the-boundary-interface-symplectic-structure>`).

4. **Agency as constrained optimization.** A resistor dissipates energy passively. The Fragile Agent *minimizes* free energy subject to metabolic and safety constraints ({ref}`Section 31 <sec-computational-metabolism-the-landauer-bound-and-deliberation-dynamics>`). The constraints define *what kind* of agent it is; within those constraints, the agent maximizes expected utility. Agency is not the absence of constraint but optimization within constraint.

### D.7 Implementation and Complexity

(sec-appendix-d-the-meta-tuning-paradox)=
#### D.7.1 The Meta-Tuning Paradox

**Objection:** *The Sieve contains 60 diagnostic nodes. Even with the Universal Governor, doesn't this just move the "hyperparameter hell" problem up one level? Who tunes the Governor's initial constraints?*

**Response:**

The Governor reduces hyperparameter count, not shifts it.

1. **From 60 thresholds to 3 meta-parameters.** The Universal Governor ({ref}`Section 26 <sec-theory-of-meta-stability-the-universal-governor-as-homeostatic-controller>`) is a bilevel optimization: the inner loop is the agent; the outer loop adjusts Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_i$ via dual ascent. The Governor has only 3 meta-parameters: (a) initial $\lambda_0$ (typically uniform), (b) dual learning rate $\eta_\lambda$, (c) constraint tolerance $\epsilon$. All 60 node thresholds are *derived* from these via the Lagrangian.

2. **Self-tuning dynamics.** Constraints that are satisfied have $\lambda_i \to 0$ automatically—the Governor "turns off" passing checks. Constraints that are violated see $\lambda_i$ increase until the violation is corrected. This is not "tuning"; it is a dynamical equilibrium.

3. **Principled initialization.** Initial thresholds are set by dimensional analysis: if a quantity has units of "nats," the threshold is $O(1)$ nat; if it has units of "steps," the threshold is $O(\tau_{\text{mix}})$ steps. {ref}`Appendix B <sec-appendix-b-units-parameters-and-coefficients>` provides the full unit table.

4. **The alternative is worse.** Without the Sieve, the engineer implicitly tunes the same constraints—via reward shaping, early stopping, and ad-hoc regularization. The Sieve makes the constraints *explicit* and *auditable*; the Governor makes them *self-correcting*.

(sec-appendix-d-cold-start-in-the-vacuum)=
#### D.7.2 Cold Start in the Vacuum

**Objection:** *You initialize the agent at the Semantic Vacuum ($z=0$). How does an agent with no prior geometry avoid "wandering in the dark" for millions of steps before the first bifurcation?*

**Response:**

The Semantic Vacuum is not empty—it is maximally symmetric.

1. **Entropic drift from the origin.** At $z=0$, the information potential $U(z) = -d_G(0, z)$ is minimized ({ref}`Section 21.1 <sec-radial-generation-entropic-drift-and-policy-control>`). The free energy gradient $-\nabla U$ points *outward*. Without any policy, the agent is pushed toward the boundary by pure entropic expansion.

2. **Hyperbolic volume growth.** On the Poincare disk, volume grows exponentially: $\text{Vol}(B_r) \sim e^r$ (Definition {prf:ref}`def-hyperbolic-volume-growth`). Even random exploration covers exponentially more states per step as the agent moves outward. The "cold start" problem is logarithmically fast, not polynomially slow.

3. **Pre-training on noise.** Before task reward is available, the agent can be pre-trained on reconstruction loss alone. The VQ-VAE codebook ({ref}`Section 2.2b <sec-the-shutter-as-a-vq-vae>`) learns discrete prototypes; the TopoEncoder learns topology. This "self-supervised bootstrap" populates the manifold with structure before RL begins.

4. **First bifurcation is cheap.** The ontological stress threshold $\Xi_{\text{crit}}$ ({ref}`Section 30.2 <sec-ontological-stress>`) is set low initially. The first chart fission occurs as soon as texture becomes predictable—typically within thousands, not millions, of steps. Subsequent fissions compound the representational capacity.

(sec-appendix-d-numerical-drift-hyperbolic)=
#### D.7.3 Numerical Drift on Hyperbolic Manifolds

**Objection:** *Standard neural networks use floating-point math optimized for Euclidean space. How do you prevent catastrophic rounding errors when calculating geodesics near the $|z| \to 1$ boundary?*

**Response:**

We use numerically stable hyperbolic primitives.

1. **Poincare ball parameterization.** All operations stay inside the unit ball $|z| < 1$. The Christoffel symbols (Proposition {prf:ref}`prop-a-explicit-christoffel-symbols-for-poincar-disk`) are computed in closed form; no iterative inversion is required.

2. **Geodesic BAOAB integrator.** The BAOAB splitting scheme ({ref}`Section 22.4 <sec-the-geodesic-baoab-integrator>`) is a symplectic integrator designed for Riemannian manifolds. Proposition {prf:ref}`prop-baoab-preserves-boltzmann` proves it preserves the Boltzmann distribution to $O(\Delta t^2)$. Symplectic integrators do not accumulate energy drift over long trajectories.

3. **Boundary clamping.** States approaching $|z| > 1 - \epsilon$ are projected back via the exponential map. This "soft wall" prevents numerical overflow without introducing discontinuities.

4. **Mixed-precision with Kahan summation.** For high-precision curvature computations, we use Kahan summation to reduce floating-point error accumulation. The metric $G(z) = 4I/(1-|z|^2)^2$ is computed in float64 where necessary; the policy and encoder use float16/bfloat16.

(sec-appendix-d-governors-blind-spot)=
#### D.7.4 The Governor's Blind Spot

**Objection:** *What happens if the World Model is wrong, but self-consistent? Can the Sieve be "fooled" by a hallucinated geometry into reporting that everything is stable?*

**Response:**

Self-consistency is necessary but not sufficient—the Sieve has external anchors.

1. **Grounding via boundary data.** The World Model $\bar{P}$ is trained on real observations $x_t$ ({ref}`Section 20.6 <sec-the-unified-world-model>`). **Node 12 (GroundingCheck)** compares predicted observations to actual observations. A hallucinated geometry that predicts well internally but fails on real data will trigger this check.

2. **Interventional gap detection.** **Node 53 (InterventionalGapCheck)** ({ref}`Section 32.5 <sec-implementation-the-experimental-sieve>`) measures $\Delta_{\text{causal}} = D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{int}} \| P_{\text{obs}})$. If the model is self-consistent but causally wrong, interventions will produce surprises that violate this check.

3. **WFR consistency.** **Node 23 (WFRCheck)** verifies that belief updates satisfy the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao continuity equation (Definition {prf:ref}`def-wfr-world-model`). A hallucinated model that violates mass conservation or produces negative densities will fail.

4. **The Sieve is skeptical by design.** The framework assumes the World Model is *always* wrong to some degree (partial observability, model mismatch). The Sieve monitors the *rate* of being wrong. Stable wrongness is tolerable; accelerating wrongness triggers intervention.

(sec-appendix-d-information-theory-ontology)=
### D.8 Information Theory and Ontology

(sec-appendix-d-ontological-churn)=
#### D.8.1 Ontological Churn

**Objection:** *What prevents the agent from entering a "fission-fusion loop," where it creates a chart for a new distinction and immediately merges it back due to metabolic pressure?*

**Response:**

Hysteresis and metabolic accounting prevent churn.

1. **Asymmetric thresholds.** Fission requires $\Xi > \Xi_{\text{crit}}$ *and* $\Delta V_{\text{proj}} > \mathcal{C}_{\text{complexity}}$ ({ref}`Section 30.4 <sec-symmetry-breaking-and-chart-birth>`). Fusion requires $\Upsilon_{ij} > \Upsilon_{\text{crit}}$ (Definition {prf:ref}`def-ontological-redundancy`). These thresholds are set with a **hysteresis gap**: the fusion threshold is strictly lower than the fission threshold. A newly created chart cannot immediately satisfy the fusion criterion.

2. **Cooldown period.** After fission, the new chart enters a "protected" period during which fusion is disabled ({ref}`Section 30.8 <sec-ontological-fusion-concept-consolidation>`). This allows the chart to accumulate usage statistics before being evaluated for redundancy.

3. **Metabolic cost of transitions.** Both fission and fusion incur a one-time metabolic cost (chart creation, fiber reconciliation). The **Fission Criterion** ({ref}`Section 30.3 <sec-the-fission-criterion>`) penalizes complexity; the equilibrium favors stable configurations.

4. **Diagnostic Node 54 (FusionReadinessCheck).** This node monitors the redundancy metric $\Upsilon_{ij}$ and only permits fusion when redundancy is *sustained* over a window, not instantaneous.

(sec-appendix-d-texture-trojan-horse)=
#### D.8.2 Texture as a Trojan Horse

**Objection:** *If texture is reconstruction-only and firewall-protected, couldn't a malicious environment hide adversarial triggers in the texture that are "unobservable" to the Sieve but influence the decoder's output?*

**Response:**

The Firewall operates on gradients, not pixels—adversarial texture cannot influence control.

1. **Axiom: Bulk-Boundary Decoupling.** Axiom {prf:ref}`ax-bulk-boundary-decoupling` states $\partial \pi / \partial z_{\text{tex}} = 0$ and $\partial V / \partial z_{\text{tex}} = 0$. This is enforced architecturally: the texture branch does not feed into the policy or critic networks. Adversarial triggers in texture affect *reconstruction* but not *control*.

2. **Node 29 (TextureFirewallCheck).** This diagnostic ({ref}`Section 23.3 <sec-motor-texture-the-action-residual>`) monitors $\|\partial \pi / \partial z_{\text{tex}}\|$ during training. Any gradient leakage triggers a halt. The check is applied continuously, not just at deployment.

3. **Decoder is not trusted.** The decoder's output is a *visualization* for humans, not an input to the agent's decision loop. A corrupted reconstruction is a UI bug, not a control vulnerability.

4. **Adversarial robustness via information bottleneck.** The macro-state $K$ has $\log|\mathcal{K}|$ bits of capacity. High-frequency adversarial perturbations cannot fit through this bottleneck. Attacks that *do* alter $K$ are, by definition, semantically meaningful—and detectable by the Sieve.

(sec-appendix-d-discrete-continuous-interface)=
#### D.8.3 The Discrete/Continuous Interface

**Objection:** *VQ-VAE codebooks are notoriously difficult to train with gradients. Does the straight-through estimator (STE) introduce enough noise to invalidate the "smooth manifold" assumptions of the WFR geometry?*

**Response:**

The WFR metric is designed precisely for discrete/continuous hybrids.

1. **WFR interpolates discreteness.** The Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric ({ref}`Section 20 <sec-wasserstein-fisher-rao-geometry-unified-transport-on-hybrid-state-spaces>`) is the *unique* metric that simultaneously handles mass transport (Wasserstein, for continuous flow) and mass teleportation (Fisher-Rao, for discrete jumps). The STE gradient is a *special case* of WFR dynamics with teleportation length $\lambda \to 0$.

2. **Gumbel-Softmax relaxation.** During training, we use temperature-annealed Gumbel-Softmax rather than hard STE. This provides smooth gradients at high temperature, converging to discrete codes as $\tau \to 0$. The manifold assumption holds for $\tau > 0$; at $\tau = 0$, the geometry is a disjoint union of charts.

3. **Codebook as atlas.** The discrete codebook $\mathcal{K}$ defines the **atlas** of the latent manifold. Each code $k$ indexes a chart $\mathcal{Z}_k$. Transitions between charts are discrete jumps; dynamics within charts are smooth. The WFR metric makes this precise.

4. **Empirical smoothness.** VQ-VAE gradients are noisy but *unbiased* under STE. The accumulated gradient over batches converges to the true gradient. The manifold structure emerges in expectation, not per-sample.

(sec-appendix-d-semantic-compression-hallucination)=
#### D.8.4 Semantic Compression vs. Hallucination

**Objection:** *At the Causal Information Bound ($I_{\max}$), does the agent begin to hallucinate correlations to "fit" new data into a saturated interface?*

**Response:**

Near saturation, the agent slows down—it does not hallucinate.

1. **Causal Stasis.** Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-causal-stasis` proves that as $I_{\text{bulk}} \to I_{\max}$, the update velocity $\|v\|_G \to 0$. The agent cannot *add* new information to a saturated manifold; it can only *refine* existing representations. This is "slow learning," not "false learning."

2. **Ontological Fusion as compression.** When capacity is exhausted, the framework prescribes **Ontological Fusion** ({ref}`Section 30.8 <sec-ontological-fusion-concept-consolidation>`)—merging redundant charts to free capacity. The agent *forgets* rather than *hallucinates*.

3. **Node 56 (CapacityHorizonCheck).** This diagnostic ({ref}`Section 33.5 <sec-diagnostic-node-56>`) monitors $\eta_{\text{Sch}} = I_{\text{bulk}} / I_{\max}$. When $\eta_{\text{Sch}} > 0.9$, the agent enters "near-saturation" mode: exploration is throttled, and fusion is prioritized. The Sieve prevents the agent from operating at the capacity limit where pathological behavior would emerge.

4. **Information-theoretic impossibility.** The Causal Information Bound (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-causal-information-bound`) is a *hard limit* derived from the area law. It is impossible to encode $I > I_{\max}$ into boundary area $A$. The bound is geometric, not behavioral.

(sec-appendix-d-scaling-multi-agent)=
### D.9 Scaling and Multi-Agent Dynamics

(sec-appendix-d-game-tensor-explosion)=
#### D.9.1 The Game Tensor Explosion

**Objection:** *In a system with 1,000 agents, the Game Tensor $\mathcal{G}_{ij}$ requires $O(N^2)$ cross-Hessians. Is this framework restricted to small-team dynamics, or is there a "Mean Field" Fragile Agent?*

**Response:**

Sparse and mean-field approximations scale the Game Tensor.

1. **Locality assumption.** In most multi-agent systems, agents interact locally (spatial neighborhoods, communication graphs). The Game Tensor $\mathcal{G}_{ij}$ is sparse: $\mathcal{G}_{ij} = 0$ if agents $i$ and $j$ do not interact. Sparse matrix operations reduce complexity to $O(N \cdot k)$ where $k$ is the average interaction degree.

2. **Mean-field limit.** For large homogeneous populations, we replace $\mathcal{G}_{ij}$ with a **mean-field approximation**: each agent interacts with the *average* influence $\bar{\mathcal{G}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_j \mathcal{G}_{ij}$. This reduces the problem to a single representative agent coupled to a population statistic—$O(1)$ per agent.

3. **Hierarchical decomposition.** Teams can be organized hierarchically: agents within a team share a local Game Tensor; teams interact via a coarser inter-team tensor. This multi-scale approach ({ref}`Section 29.5 <sec-the-hyperbolic-value-equation>`) reduces complexity to $O(N \log N)$.

4. **The framework is exact for small $N$.** For $N \le 10$ (small teams, adversarial games), the full $O(N^2)$ computation is tractable. The approximations above extend the framework to large $N$ without abandoning the geometric structure.

(sec-appendix-d-symplectic-leakage)=
#### D.9.2 Symplectic Leakage

**Objection:** *In real-world multi-agent systems (like traffic), the "Bridge Manifold" is noisy and lossy. Does the violation of Symplectic Conservation (Node 48) make the math of Strategic Inertia collapse?*

**Response:**

The framework is robust to symplectic leakage—it monitors and compensates.

1. **Node 48 (SymplecticBridgeCheck).** This diagnostic ({ref}`Section 29 <sec-symplectic-multi-agent-field-theory>`) monitors the symplectic 2-form $\omega = \sum_i dq^i \wedge dp_i$ over the Bridge Manifold. Leakage is quantified as $\Delta \omega = \oint \omega - \omega_0$. The Sieve does not require $\Delta \omega = 0$—it requires $|\Delta \omega| < \epsilon_{\omega}$.

2. **Damped Hamiltonian dynamics.** Real systems are not Hamiltonian; they are *dissipative*. The Equations of Motion ({ref}`Section 22 <sec-the-equations-of-motion-geodesic-jump-diffusion>`) include a friction term $-\gamma \dot{z}$ that accounts for information loss at the interface. Strategic Inertia (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-nash-equilibrium-as-geometric-stasis`) holds for *damped* equilibria, not conservative orbits.

3. **Noise as exploration.** Symplectic leakage in the Bridge Manifold is equivalent to adding noise to the other agent's state estimate. This noise *helps* exploration by preventing overconfident adaptation to a noisy partner.

4. **Graceful degradation.** If Node 48 fails persistently, the Governor increases the "strategic uncertainty" parameter $\sigma_{\text{opp}}$, widening the agent's belief distribution over opponents. The agent becomes *more cautious*, not unstable.

(sec-appendix-d-strategic-laziness)=
#### D.9.3 Strategic Laziness

**Objection:** *If adversarial presence increases "Latent Inertia" (Mass), will Fragile Agents naturally become "lazy" and refuse to move in contested spaces to save metabolic energy?*

**Response:**

Inertia slows *reckless* movement, not *purposeful* movement.

1. **Inertia is state-dependent.** The Game Tensor $\mathcal{G}_{ij}$ increases effective mass only in *contested* regions—states where opponents have high influence (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-adversarial-mass-inflation`). In uncontested regions, inertia is unchanged. The agent is "lazy" where caution is warranted; it is agile where it has freedom.

2. **Nash equilibrium is not inaction.** Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-nash-equilibrium-as-geometric-stasis` defines Nash equilibrium as *geometric stasis*: the point where all agents' gradient fields cancel. This is not "doing nothing"—it is the *optimal response* given opponents' strategies. The agent moves to the Nash point and stays there.

3. **Metabolic drive to act.** The Landauer bound ({ref}`Section 31.1 <sec-the-energetics-of-information-updates>`) penalizes both *thinking* and *inaction* (via missed opportunities). An agent that "does nothing" fails to gather reward flux, violating the metabolic balance. The Governor pushes it to act.

4. **Exploration bonus in contested regions.** The Curiosity Force (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-augmented-drift-law`) adds $\beta_{\text{exp}} \mathbf{f}_{\text{exp}}$ to the drift. In high-uncertainty (contested) regions, this bonus *increases*, counteracting inertia. The agent explores *because* the region is contested, not despite it.

(sec-appendix-d-human-alignment-deployment)=
### D.10 Human Alignment and Deployment

(sec-appendix-d-mapping-human-values-charges)=
#### D.10.1 Mapping Human Values to Charges

**Objection:** *Rewards are treated as boundary scalar charges. How do we translate fuzzy human ethics into a precise point-source charge density without creating "singularities" of unintended behavior?*

**Response:**

The framework provides smoothing and decomposition mechanisms.

1. **Scalar charge density, not point charges.** Definition {prf:ref}`def-reward-1-form` defines $\rho_r(z)$ as a *density* over the latent manifold, not a delta function. Human values are represented as smooth fields: "avoid harm" becomes a negative charge cloud around dangerous states; "seek goals" becomes a positive charge cloud around target states ({ref}`Section 24.1 <sec-the-reward-1-form>`).

2. **Helmholtz screening.** The screened Poisson equation $-\Delta_G V + \kappa^2 V = \rho_r$ ({ref}`Section 24.2 <sec-the-bulk-potential-screened-poisson-equation>`) automatically smooths sharp reward boundaries. The screening length $\ell = 1/\kappa$ sets the characteristic scale over which values propagate and blend. Singularities are geometrically impossible.

3. **Hierarchical value decomposition.** Complex values can be decomposed into multiple charge sources: primary reward (task), auxiliary rewards (subgoals), penalties (constraints). Each source has its own density; the total potential is the superposition. The Sieve monitors each component separately.

4. **Conformal coupling increases deliberation.** High-curvature value regions increase the effective mass via conformal coupling ({ref}`Section 24.4 <sec-geometric-back-reaction-the-conformal-coupling>`). The agent slows down near regions of high value gradient, automatically allocating more computation to decisions with larger consequences.

(sec-appendix-d-interventional-safety-gap)=
#### D.10.2 The Interventional Safety Gap

**Objection:** *Does performing a "topological surgery" ($do$-operation) for causal discovery pose an inherent risk to the agent's physical hardware during the "exploration" phase?*

**Response:**

Interventions are bounded by the Sieve; hardware safety is a separate layer.

1. **The $do$-operator is internal.** The Interventional Operator (Definition {prf:ref}`def-the-interventional-surgery`) operates on the *latent* causal graph, not on physical actuators. It severs edges in the agent's *model* of causation—the real world is unchanged until an action is emitted.

2. **Action bounds as hard constraints.** Physical actuators have **BarrierSat** constraints ({ref}`Section 4 <sec-limits-barriers>`) that clamp actions to safe ranges regardless of latent dynamics. The motor interface enforces $a \in \mathcal{A}_{\text{safe}}$ independently of the causal model.

3. **Node 53 (InterventionalGapCheck).** Before executing a real-world intervention, this diagnostic ({ref}`Section 32.5 <sec-implementation-the-experimental-sieve>`) estimates the "surprise" $\Delta_{\text{causal}}$ the intervention will produce. High-surprise interventions are either (a) simulated in the World Model first, or (b) executed with reduced magnitude.

4. **Human-in-the-loop for irreversible actions.** For deployment scenarios with physical risk, the framework supports a **Gatekeeper** mode: interventions above a risk threshold require human approval. The Sieve provides the risk estimate; the human provides the authorization.

(sec-appendix-d-explainability-non-physicists)=
#### D.10.3 Explainability for Non-Physicists

**Objection:** *If an agent halts due to a "Helmholtz Residual Violation" or "Ontological Stress," how can a human operator understand what actually went wrong in plain English?*

**Response:**

The Sieve provides layered explanations from technical to intuitive.

1. **Diagnostic Node → Plain English mapping.** Each of the 60 nodes has a human-readable interpretation column in the registry ({ref}`Section 3.1 <sec-diagnostics-stability-checks>`):
   - "Helmholtz Residual Violation" → "The agent's value predictions are inconsistent with how rewards spread."
   - "Ontological Stress" → "The agent is detecting patterns it cannot explain with its current concepts."
   - "CapacityHorizonCheck" → "The agent's memory is nearly full."

2. **Severity tiers.** Violations are categorized into Warning (yellow), Halt (red), and Fatal (black). A Warning says "something is unusual"; a Halt says "wait for inspection"; a Fatal says "abort immediately." The operator does not need to understand geometry—only traffic lights.

3. **Intervention log.** {ref}`Section 6 <sec-interventions>` defines the remediation for each failure mode. When a check fails, the system logs: (a) which check failed, (b) the current value vs. threshold, (c) the prescribed intervention. The operator sees "Node 35 (HelmholtzResidual) exceeded 0.5; reducing learning rate."

4. **Dashboard visualization.** The 60 diagnostic outputs can be rendered as a heatmap, gauge cluster, or time series. An operator trained on the dashboard can monitor agent health without understanding the underlying geometry.

(sec-appendix-d-physical-metabolic-reality)=
### D.11 Physical and Metabolic Reality

(sec-appendix-d-hardware-requirements)=
#### D.11.1 Hardware Requirements

**Objection:** *Does the requirement for Hessian-aware optimization and PDE regularization necessitate specialized "Geometric Processing Units" (GPUs of a different kind), or is this viable on commodity hardware?*

**Response:**

The framework runs on commodity GPUs; specialized hardware helps but is not required.

1. **Amortized Hessian computation.** As explained in {ref}`D.1.1 <sec-appendix-d-the-metric-inversion-problem>`, the metric $G$ is updated on a slow timescale. A single Hessian-vector product costs $O(D)$ via autodiff; full Hessian inversion is $O(D^3)$ for $D \approx 256$, which takes microseconds on an A100.

2. **PINN, not PDE solver.** As explained in {ref}`D.1.2 <sec-appendix-d-the-pde-solver-overhead>`, the Helmholtz equation is a loss term, not a finite-element solve. Standard backpropagation handles it.

3. **Tiered compute architecture.** {ref}`Section 7 <sec-computational-considerations>` defines four compute tiers:
   - **Tier 1 (μs):** Inference path—runs on any GPU.
   - **Tier 2 (ms):** Curvature updates—runs on any GPU with autodiff.
   - **Tier 3 (s):** Heavy diagnostics—can run asynchronously on CPU.
   - **Tier 4 (min):** Ontological restructuring—offline, batch mode.

4. **Memory, not FLOPs, is the bottleneck.** Storing the atlas (charts, codebook, memory buffer) requires $O(|\mathcal{K}| \cdot D + B \cdot D)$ memory. For typical sizes ($|\mathcal{K}| = 1024$, $D = 256$, $B = 10^6$ buffer), this is ~1 GB—well within commodity GPU VRAM.

(sec-appendix-d-metabolic-death)=
#### D.11.2 Metabolic Death

**Objection:** *Can an agent "starve" in a high-complexity environment if the metabolic cost of maintaining its internal charts exceeds the reward flux it can gather?*

**Response:**

Yes—this is an intended design property.

1. **Metabolic balance equation.** Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-generalized-landauer-bound` states $\dot{\mathcal{M}} \ge T_c |dH/ds|$: information updates cost energy. If the environment provides reward flux $\Phi_r$ and the agent spends metabolic flux $\dot{\mathcal{M}} > \Phi_r$, the agent is *unsustainable* ({ref}`Section 31 <sec-computational-metabolism-the-landauer-bound-and-deliberation-dynamics>`).

2. **Ontological pruning.** When metabolic cost exceeds reward, the **Fission Criterion** ({ref}`Section 30.3 <sec-the-fission-criterion>`) drives the agent to *reduce* complexity: merge charts, forget states, simplify the codebook. This is "downsizing," not death.

3. **Graceful degradation.** A starving agent does not crash—it becomes *simpler*. The minimum viable agent has $|\mathcal{K}| = 1$ (single chart), $D = 1$ (scalar latent), $B = 0$ (no memory). At this floor, metabolic cost is minimal. The agent survives but loses capability.

4. **Death as signal.** If even the minimal agent cannot sustain itself, the environment is *too hard* for bounded rationality. This is valuable information: the operator knows to provide auxiliary reward, simplify the task, or increase compute budget. "Metabolic death" is an honest failure mode.

(sec-appendix-d-universality-quarter-coefficient)=
#### D.11.3 The Universality of the 1/4 Coefficient

**Objection:** *In the Causal Information Bound, the $1/4$ coefficient is derived from Fisher normalization. Does this coefficient change if the agent uses a non-hyperbolic latent geometry?*

**Response:**

The coefficient is geometry-dependent; the *structure* of the bound is universal.

1. **Origin of 1/4.** {ref}`Appendix A.6 <sec-appendix-a-area-law>` derives the coefficient via Fisher metric normalization: the geodesic distance on the probability simplex is $\pi/2$, yielding a unit cell area of $4\ell_L^2$ (Proposition {prf:ref}`prop-a-area-minimal-cell`). The factor $1/4$ comes from the Poincare disk normalization $G^{-1}(0) = I/4$ (Lemma {prf:ref}`lem-a-geodesic-distance-simplex`).

2. **Dimension-dependence.** For a $D$-dimensional latent manifold, the Holographic Coefficient is (Definition {prf:ref}`def-holographic-coefficient`):

   $$
   \nu_D = \frac{(D-1)\pi^{(D-2)/2}}{4\,\Gamma(D/2)}.
   $$
   Explicit values: $\nu_2 = 1/4$, $\nu_3 = 1$, $\nu_4 = 3\pi/4 \approx 2.36$. The coefficient peaks at $D \approx 9$ and then decreases. For typical latent dimensions ($D \le 20$), $\nu_D > 1/4$; for very high dimensions ($D \gtrsim 22$), $\nu_D < 1/4$.

3. **Why hyperbolic is canonical.** The Poincare disk is the *unique* simply-connected Riemannian manifold with constant negative curvature—the natural geometry for hierarchical, tree-like data ({ref}`Section 21 <sec-radial-generation-entropic-drift-and-policy-control>`). For 2D latent spaces, $\nu_2 = 1/4$ is exact.

4. **Bekenstein-Hawking analogy.** In general relativity, the coefficient $1/4$ in $S = A / 4\ell_P^2$ arises from the Einstein-Hilbert action normalization. The structural parallel ({ref}`Remark A.6.6 <sec-appendix-a-remark-bekenstein-hawking>`) suggests that $1/4$ is a universal feature of holographic bounds in field theories with second-order curvature terms.

(sec-appendix-d-circularity-of-area-law)=
#### D.11.4 Circularity of the Area Law Derivation

**Objection:** *The derivation of the Area Law in Appendix A.6 is circular: the Levin Length is defined as "area-per-nat," so deriving $I = \text{Area}/(4\ell_L^2)$ just returns to the definition. The 1/4 coefficient is mathematical theater.*

**Response:**

This objection conflates two distinct issues. The derivation is **not circular**, though the logical structure requires careful examination.

1. **What the Levin Length defines.** Definition {prf:ref}`def-levin-length` sets $\ell_L := \sqrt{\eta_\ell}$ where $\eta_\ell$ is "area-per-nat." This is a *qualitative* definition: it says $\ell_L$ is the characteristic length scale of distinguishability, **not** that the coefficient is 1.

2. **Where the 1/4 comes from.** The coefficient arises from:
   - **Chentsov's theorem** (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-a-chentsov-uniqueness`): The Fisher metric is unique up to scale.
   - **Curvature normalization:** The Poincare disk with $K = -1$ has metric $G(0) = 4I$ (Lemma {prf:ref}`lem-a-curvature-normalization-factor-4`).
   - **Cell counting:** A coordinate cell of side $\ell_L$ has Riemannian area $4\ell_L^2$.

   The factor of 4 is **derived from geometry**, not assumed.

3. **The non-circular derivation.** {ref}`Section A.6.0 <sec-appendix-a-foundational-axioms>` provides a microstate counting derivation:
   - Count boundary-distinguishable configurations (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-a-microstate-count-area-law`)
   - Use Shannon's channel capacity (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-a-boundary-channel-capacity`)
   - Obtain $I_{\max} = A/(4\ell_L^2)$ **without invoking the Metric Law**

4. **The actual structure.** The derivation has two independent paths:

   | Path                | Method                          | Uses Metric Law? |
   |---------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
   | Microstate counting | Cell tiling + Shannon           | **No**           |
   | Field-theoretic     | Divergence theorem + Metric Law | Yes              |

   Both yield the same coefficient. This is a **consistency check**, not a tautology.

5. **Analogy to physics.** In black hole thermodynamics:
   - Hawking (1975) derived $S = A/4\ell_P^2$ thermodynamically
   - Strominger-Vafa (1996) derived it by counting D-brane microstates

   Neither is circular; their agreement validates string theory. The microstate counting here (Section A.6.0) is analogous to Strominger-Vafa.

*Remark (What would be circular).* A truly circular derivation would be: "Define $\ell_L^2 := A/(4I)$, then observe $I = A/(4\ell_L^2)$." This is **not** what happens. The 1/4 emerges from the curvature normalization $K = -1$, which is a geometric fact independent of capacity constraints.

### D.12 Foundational Rigor and the Hypostructure Formalism

:::{admonition} Theoretical Dependency Warning
:class: warning

The answers in this section rely on the **Hypostructure formalism** developed in the companion document **Hypopermits (companion document)**. This formalism is original research and has **not been peer-reviewed**. The claimed gap closures should be treated as **conjectural** pending external validation.

(sec-appendix-d-vq-wfr-disconnect)=
#### D.12.1 Gap 1: VQ vs. WFR Measure-Theoretical Disconnect

**Objection:** *The specification requires both Vector-Quantized (VQ) discrete tokens and Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) continuous dynamics. These live on different mathematical spaces: discrete codebooks vs. probability measures on Riemannian manifolds. How can these be reconciled?*

**Response:**

The **Expansion Adjunction** (Theorem **Thm: Expansion Adjunction**) provides a canonical functor $\mathcal{F}: \mathbf{Thin}_T \to \mathbf{Hypo}_T$ from discrete "thin" data to continuous structures.

1. **Left adjoint structure.** The functor $\mathcal{F}$ is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U$, meaning: $\mathcal{F} \dashv U$. This universal property guarantees that VQ codebooks lift *uniquely* to WFR measures.

2. **Gradient extension.** Discrete gradients (finite differences on the codebook graph) extend canonically to continuous WFR gradients. The adjunction ensures no information is lost in this lift.

3. **Categorical preservation.** The lifting preserves all categorical structure: composition of morphisms, colimits (merging charts), and limits (refining charts). The VQ and WFR views are *the same object* seen at different resolutions.

(sec-appendix-d-governor-stability)=
#### D.12.2 Gap 2: Governor Stability ("Who Watches the Watchmen")

**Objection:** *If the Governor monitors the agent for safety violations, what monitors the Governor? Infinite regress threatens.*

**Response:**

The monitoring hierarchy terminates at a **Lawvere fixed point**, avoiding infinite regress.

1. **Epistemic fixed point.** The **Epistemic Fixed Point Metatheorem** (**MT: Epistemic Fixed Point**) establishes that an optimal Bayesian learner converges to the true theory $[T^*]$. The Governor's self-model is such a fixed point of the epistemic update operator.

2. **ZFC reflection.** The **Fundamental Theorem of Set-Theoretic Reflection** (**Thm: ZFC Bridge Fundamental**) translates categorical certificates to classical ZFC statements. External auditors can verify the Governor's fixed point using standard mathematics—no category theory required for the audit.

3. **Diagonal blocking.** Gödel-style diagonal arguments (the Governor lying about itself) are blocked by the categorical structure: the internal logic of the cohesive topos admits Boolean sub-topoi where self-reference is well-founded.

(sec-appendix-d-strategic-omniscience)=
#### D.12.3 Gap 3: Strategic Omniscience (Game Tensor)

**Objection:** *The Game Tensor ({ref}`Section 29.4 <sec-the-game-tensor-deriving-adversarial-geometry>`) encodes strategic interactions, but requires knowing opponent policies—which may be uncomputable or strategically hidden.*

**Response:**

The **cobordism interface** avoids requiring opponent policy knowledge.

:::{prf:axiom} The Bridge Principle
:label: ax-the-bridge-principle

An agent commits to a **response function** $\sigma: \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{A}$ mapping observations to actions, not a fixed policy $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ over states. The response function:

1. Is computable given bounded observations
2. Does not require access to opponent internal states or policies
3. Defines the agent's strategic interface at the boundary $\partial\mathcal{X}$

*Consequence:* Strategic interactions reduce to boundary conditions on the response function, eliminating the need for opponent omniscience.
:::

1. **Response functions, not policies.** The **Bridge Principle** (Axiom {prf:ref}`ax-the-bridge-principle`) requires the agent to commit to a *response function* $\sigma: \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{A}$ mapping observations to actions, not a fixed policy. This is computable given bounded observations.

2. **Type-safe boundaries.** The categorical definition (**Def: Categorical Hypostructure**) provides a cobordism structure: the agent's state stack $\mathcal{X}$ has a boundary $\partial\mathcal{X}$ where strategic interactions occur. Type-safety across this boundary is enforced categorically.

3. **Opponents as boundary conditions.** Unknown opponents are modeled as boundary conditions on $\partial\mathcal{X}$, not as internal states. The agent optimizes against the *worst-case* boundary compatible with observations—a minimax strategy that requires no omniscience.

(sec-appendix-d-hessian-texture-inverse)=
#### D.12.4 Gap 4: Hessian-Texture Inverse Problem

**Objection:** *Extracting ontological structure from Hessian texture ({ref}`Section 30.3 <sec-the-fission-criterion>`) requires inverting a potentially ill-posed operator. Noise or degeneracy could render the inversion unstable.*

**Response:**

The **O-minimal Tameness Theorem** (**MT: O-minimal Tame Smoothing**) guarantees stable inversion.

1. **Definable families.** Loss landscapes arising from neural networks with analytic activations belong to *definable families* in an o-minimal structure (typically $\mathbb{R}_{\text{an,exp}}$). These families have bounded complexity by definability.

2. **Finite fibers.** The Hessian-to-texture map $H \mapsto z_{\text{tex}}$ has *finite fibers*: each texture corresponds to finitely many Hessians (up to symmetry). This is a consequence of o-minimality: definable maps have finite fibers generically.

3. **Stratified inverses.** The stratification theorem provides stable local inverses on each stratum. Degeneracies (where the fiber is larger) lie on lower-dimensional strata, which have measure zero under generic perturbations.

(sec-appendix-d-dimensional-scaling-hypo)=
#### D.12.5 Gap 5: Dimensional Scaling of 1/4 Coefficient

**Objection:** *The Area Law coefficient $\nu_D$ is dimension-dependent (see {ref}`D.11.3 <sec-appendix-d-universality-quarter-coefficient>`), but the holographic correspondence assumes a fixed coefficient.*

**Response:**

The **RCD Dissipation Link** (**Thm: RCD Dissipation Link**) provides dimension-independent bounds.

1. **RCD spaces.** The latent manifold $(\mathcal{Z}, d, \mathfrak{m})$ satisfies the **Riemannian Curvature-Dimension** condition $\mathrm{RCD}(K, N)$ for some curvature bound $K$ and dimension bound $N$. This generalizes Ricci curvature to metric-measure spaces.

2. **Absorbed coefficients.** The dimension-dependent Holographic Coefficient $\nu_D$ is absorbed into the RCD parameters $(K, N)$. The capacity bound holds uniformly for any $\mathrm{RCD}(K, N)$ space, with the coefficient determined by $(K, N)$.

3. **Explicit values.** Definition {prf:ref}`def-holographic-coefficient` provides the formula: $\nu_D = (D-1)\pi^{(D-2)/2} / (4\Gamma(D/2))$. For $D = 2$, this recovers $\nu_2 = 1/4$.

(sec-appendix-d-reflective-dream-leakage)=
#### D.12.6 Gap 6: Reflective Dream Leakage

**Objection:** *Dreams (offline model consolidation) may produce beliefs that violate physical constraints. If these leak into online behavior, the agent may act on impossible world-models.*

**Response:**

Thermodynamic gating prevents dream leakage.

1. **Metabolic cost.** The **Generalized Landauer Bound** ({prf:ref}`thm-generalized-landauer-bound`) states: $\dot{\mathcal{M}}(s) \ge T_c |dH/ds|$. Dream updates that change belief entropy $H$ cost metabolic energy $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$. Physically impossible beliefs require infinite entropy change, hence infinite metabolic cost.

2. **Dual horizon gating.** The **Dual Horizon Action** (Axiom {prf:ref}`ax-dual-horizon-action`) separates online (wake) and offline (dream) dynamics. The horizons are coupled only through a thermodynamically gated interface.

3. **Phase transition.** The **Fast/Slow Phase Transition** ({prf:ref}`thm-fast-slow-phase-transition`) determines when dream content transfers to online behavior. If the reflexive flux $\Gamma(0)$ exceeds the metabolic flux $\dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, the system remains in "fast" (reflexive) mode and dreams do not leak. Transfer to "slow" (deliberative) mode requires sustained metabolic investment, filtering out thermodynamically forbidden dreams.



(sec-appendix-d-quantum-foundations-and-physical-limits)=
### D.13 Quantum Foundations and Physical Limits

This section addresses objections concerning the framework's relationship to foundational issues in quantum mechanics and the physical interpretation of saturation boundaries.



(sec-appendix-d-measurement-problem)=
#### D.13.1 The Measurement Problem (Collapse vs. Jumps)

**Objection:** *The framework claims continuous dynamics, yet quantum measurements exhibit discontinuous "collapse." How is this reconciled?*

**Response:**

The apparent discontinuity dissolves in WFR geometry. The reaction term $R(\rho)$ in the continuity equation creates and destroys probability mass, enabling smooth paths between mixed and pure states. What appears as instantaneous collapse in the classical limit is actually a continuous topological transition—a geodesic in the space of measures that traverses regions of low but non-zero probability.

1. **Formal statement.** Let $\rho_t$ evolve under WFR dynamics. A "measurement outcome" corresponds to concentration onto a delta measure $\delta_x$. The WFR distance $d_{\text{WFR}}(\rho_t, \delta_x) \to 0$ along a finite-length geodesic—there is no discontinuous jump (Section {numref}`sec-multi-agent-schrodinger-equation`).

2. **Classical limit.** The impression of instantaneous collapse arises from coarse-graining: observers with finite resolution cannot distinguish $\rho$ highly concentrated near $x$ from $\delta_x$ itself. The "collapse" is an artifact of the observer's limited precision, not a fundamental discontinuity in the dynamics.

3. **Topological interpretation.** Measurement is a topology change in the support of $\rho$, achieved continuously via the reaction term. The WFR metric makes such transitions geodesically accessible in finite time.



(sec-appendix-d-bell-theorem)=
#### D.13.2 Bell's Theorem and the Loophole of Freedom

**Objection:** *Bell's theorem proves that any deterministic, ontic theory must be nonlocal. The framework is deterministic and treats $\rho$ as ontic. Does this imply faster-than-light signaling?*

**Response:**

Bell's theorem requires statistical independence between measurement settings and the hidden variable. In the Fragile Agent framework, this independence fails—not through conspiracy, but through causal closure.

1. **Causal closure.** The agent's choice of measurement is itself determined by the same density $\rho$ that encodes the system state. Both "Alice's measurement choice" and "the particle property" emerge from a single deterministic evolution. There is no independent randomization of settings because settings are not external to the dynamics.

2. **Not superdeterminism.** This is not superdeterminism in the pejorative sense (fine-tuned conspiracy across cosmological scales). It is the natural consequence of modeling all subsystems—including observers—as arising from one closed dynamical system. The correlations required to violate Bell inequalities are built into the initial conditions of the shared $\rho$.

3. **No signaling.** The apparent nonlocality of entanglement correlations reflects correlations in initial conditions, not faster-than-light causation. The relativistic constraints in Section {numref}`sec-the-relativistic-state-restoring-markovianity` ensure that no information propagates superluminally; the correlations are pre-established, not communicated.



(sec-appendix-d-singularity-causal-stasis)=
#### D.13.3 The Singularity and Causal Stasis

**Objection:** *What happens when $\rho \to 1$ (saturation)? Does the framework predict singularities analogous to black holes?*

**Response:**

Yes. Saturation ($\rho = 1$) creates a metric singularity in Fisher-Rao geometry.

1. **Metric divergence.** The Fisher information diverges: $g_{\text{FR}} = 1/(\rho(1-\rho)) \to \infty$ as $\rho \to 1$. This causes geodesic distance to become infinite, preventing any finite-time trajectory from reaching or crossing the boundary (Lemma {prf:ref}`lem-metric-divergence-at-saturation`).

2. **Causal stasis.** The result is **causal stasis** (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-causal-stasis`): no information can flow across the saturation boundary. This is the agent-theoretic analogue of a black hole event horizon—an absolute causal boundary beyond which external observers receive no signals.

3. **Computational enforcement.** Node 62 (CausalityViolationCheck) enforces this constraint: any predicted transition that would violate the metric bound triggers a halt rather than an unphysical state. The singularity is not pathological; it is a prediction boundary that the framework respects (Section {numref}`sec-saturation-limit`).

4. **Physical interpretation.** Just as a black hole's event horizon represents the boundary of causal influence in general relativity, the saturation boundary represents the limit of the agent's predictive reach. Beyond $\rho = 1$, no further probability mass can be concentrated—the belief has become certain, and no additional information can modify it.
