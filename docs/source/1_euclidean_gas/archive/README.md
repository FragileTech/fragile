### `11_hk_convergence_bounded_density_rigorous_proof.md`
**Archived**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)  
**Reason**: Content merged into `11_hk_convergence.md` Chapter 5  
**Note**: This standalone document provided the rigorous proof of the bounded density ratio. The content has been fully integrated into the main HK convergence document as Chapter 5 "Rigorous Proof of Bounded Density Ratio".

### `11_hk_convergence_original.md`
**Archived**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)  
**Reason**: Replaced by merged version with rigorous proof integrated  
**Note**: This was the original version of the HK convergence document before Chapter 5 was replaced with the rigorous proof. The old Chapter 5 contained heuristic justification; the new Chapter 5 contains the complete rigorous proof.
