  "section_summary": "Section 11 establishes the continuity properties of the distance-to-companion measurement operator. The section is structured in two main parts: (1) continuity of the expected raw distance vector for k≥2 regime, decomposing error into positional and structural components for stable and unstable walkers, and (2) mean-square continuity of the sampled raw distance vector, proving the operator satisfies the bounded variance axiom and deriving the explicit bound function F_{d,ms}. A critical result is the discontinuous behavior at k=1, where the expected distance vector becomes deterministically zero.",
