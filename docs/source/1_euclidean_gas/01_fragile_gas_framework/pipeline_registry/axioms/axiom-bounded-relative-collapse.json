  "failure_mode_analysis": "This axiom represents a critical limitation of the framework. If the condition is violated (i.e., during a catastrophic collapse where |\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_2)| / |\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_1)| < c_{\\min}), the system enters a regime where the framework's guarantees on aggregator scaling properties **do not apply**. The structural error analysis relies on asymptotic scaling arguments that break down when the swarm size changes dramatically. Specifically:\n\n1. **Loss of Scaling Validity**: The O(1/N) growth rate bounds for structural error components (see Section 2.3 on Swarm Aggregation Operators) are not certified when the alive set collapses below the c_{\\min} threshold.\n\n2. **Statistical Instability**: Aggregator operators (mean, variance computation) become unreliable with too few samples, leading to pathological statistical moments decoupled from true population properties.\n\n3. **Framework Scope Limitation**: The analysis is valid for ensuring the system remains in a stable operational regime (small perturbations, gradual attrition) but is **not certified to describe the dynamics during the very collapse events it is meant to help understand**.\n\n4. **Practical Implications**: \n   - If c_{\\min} is too small (e.g., 0.1), the framework tolerates large population losses where statistical estimates become unreliable\n   - If c_{\\min} is too large (e.g., 0.95), the framework becomes overly conservative and may reject valid operational transitions\n   - Typical values: c_{\\min} ∈ [0.5, 0.9] balance stability guarantees with operational flexibility. These values are empirically derived from the observation that aggregator estimates (particularly variance) require at least 50% sample retention to maintain statistical reliability, while values above 0.9 become too restrictive for systems experiencing natural population volatility under the cloning/killing dynamics.\n\n5. **Recovery Strategy**: If a catastrophic collapse occurs, the framework provides no guarantees until the swarm is replenished (through revival mechanisms) to restore |\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})| above the operational threshold.\n\nThis is fundamentally a **scope axiom** rather than a regularity condition - it defines where the framework's mathematical machinery is certified to work, not a property the algorithm must satisfy.",
