  "core_assumption": "The variance of the raw value measurement process, summed over all N walkers, must be uniformly bounded across all possible swarm states. This axiom prevents the stochastic noise inherent in measurement from having pathologically heavy tails that would make the expectation of the squared error diverge. It is a foundational requirement for proving that stochastic measurement operators satisfy mean-square continuity. By bounding the total variance uniformly, this axiom isolates stochastic fluctuations as a controlled, finite contribution to the total expected squared error, allowing the analytical challenge to focus on bounding the change in the mean of the measurement operator. This axiom applies to any Raw Value Operator V: Σ_N → P(ℝ^N) that is used in the algorithm's measurement pipeline.",
