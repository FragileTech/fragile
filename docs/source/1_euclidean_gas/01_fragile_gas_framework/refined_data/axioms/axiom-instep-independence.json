  "failure_mode_analysis": "**Violation of In-Step Independence destroys concentration bounds and probabilistic continuity guarantees.**\n\nWhen this axiom is violated, the following mathematical tools become unavailable:\n\n1. **McDiarmid's Inequality**: The perturbation operator continuity proof (Section 14) relies on McDiarmid's bounded differences inequality to establish concentration of the empirical displacement around its expectation. This requires that the random perturbations ξ_1, …, ξ_N are independent conditional on the swarm state. If systematic resampling or shared random seeds are used across walkers, the independence condition fails and McDiarmid cannot be applied.\n\n2. **Product Measure Structure**: The cloning transition measure continuity analysis (Section 15.2) requires that companion selections and cloning thresholds are drawn independently for each walker. If companion indices are sampled with systematic resampling (using a single shared uniform variate), the within-step dependence creates correlations that invalidate the product measure structure assumed in the proof.\n\n3. **Concentration Failure**: Without independence, the variance of aggregate quantities (e.g., total displacement, mean fitness) can grow arbitrarily depending on the correlation structure. This makes it impossible to bound tail probabilities, leading to:\n   - Unpredictable measurement noise\n   - Loss of N-uniform stability (measurement error could grow with swarm size)\n   - Potential for cascading failures where correlated random draws cause mass death events\n\n**Practical Implementation Failure Modes:**\n- Using a single PRNG stream for all walkers instead of per-walker streams\n- Systematic resampling in companion selection (single uniform for all draws)\n- Shared noise vectors across walkers (e.g., broadcasting the same ξ to all positions)\n- Time-correlated random seeds (e.g., seeding with wall-clock time within a step)\n\n**Diagnostic Indicators:**\n- Swarm exhibits synchronized behavior (all walkers move in lockstep)\n- Variance of aggregate statistics is much smaller or larger than predicted by theory\n- McDiarmid tail bounds are violated empirically (outlier events too frequent)\n- Companion selection produces identical companions for multiple walkers unexpectedly\n\n**Remediation:**\nImplement counter-based PRNGs (e.g., Random123 Philox/Threefry) to derive independent, reproducible per-walker streams keyed by (global_seed, t, i, stage). This ensures:\n- Each walker has an independent random stream\n- Reproducibility across runs with fixed seed\n- No accidental correlation from sequential PRNG calls\n- Explicit enforcement of the axiom in code structure\n\n**Theoretical Impact:**\nIf independence is violated, the analysis must be redone using:\n- Dependent-variables concentration inequalities (e.g., Azuma-Hoeffding for martingale differences)\n- Coupling arguments that explicitly account for correlation structure\n- Worst-case bounds that don't rely on concentration (much weaker guarantees)\n\nThe axiom is therefore **foundational for quantitative stability analysis** - without it, only qualitative statements about long-term behavior remain available.",
