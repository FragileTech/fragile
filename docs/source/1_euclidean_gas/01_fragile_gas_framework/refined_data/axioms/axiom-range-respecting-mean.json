  "condition": "This axiom applies to any aggregator used in the framework that is described as a 'mean-type' aggregator. It must hold for any finite set of input values.",
  "failure_mode_analysis": "If an aggregator violates this axiom, it could produce outputs that are outside the range of its inputs. This can lead to severe instability in the system's dynamics. For example, if a mean could be larger than the maximum input, feedback loops could cause values to grow without bound, leading to numerical explosion and algorithmic failure. Conversely, if the mean could be smaller than the minimum, it could artificially suppress signals.",
