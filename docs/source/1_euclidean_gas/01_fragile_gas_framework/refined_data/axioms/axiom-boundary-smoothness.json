    "intuition": "Imagine the valid region is like a country, and the boundary is like its border. A 'smooth' border (like a gentle curve) has zero area—it's just a line in 2D or a surface in 3D. But a 'fractal' border (like a coastline with infinite detail at all scales) could have positive area, meaning walkers might get 'stuck' exactly on the boundary with non-zero probability. Mathematically, we need the boundary to be a nice, smooth curve/surface so that the probability of landing exactly on it is zero under continuous noise. This keeps our death probability calculations clean and continuous—small changes in walker positions lead to small changes in death probability, not sudden jumps.",
    "why_c1_suffices": "The $C^1$ (continuously differentiable) condition is precisely calibrated: it's strong enough to guarantee Lebesgue measure zero via the implicit function theorem and Sard's theorem (regularity theory), but weak enough to allow many practical geometries without requiring $C^2$ smoothness (curvature regularity) or $C^\\infty$ (infinite differentiability). This makes it a practical standard.",
    "measure_theory_connection": "A $(d-1)$-dimensional smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ has Hausdorff dimension exactly $d-1$. By standard results in geometric measure theory, this implies it has $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero: $\\lambda_d(\\partial \\mathcal{X}_{\\mathrm{valid}}) = 0$. This is the key property that makes integration against absolutely continuous kernels (like Gaussian noise) well-behaved—the boundary contributes nothing to the integral.",
    "physical_analogy": "Think of walkers as particles undergoing diffusion (random walks). If the boundary is smooth, particles approaching it from nearby positions have similar probabilities of crossing it (continuity). If the boundary has corners or fractal structure, nearby particles can have wildly different crossing probabilities (discontinuity), making the system unpredictable.",
    "historical_context": "The requirement for $C^1$ boundary regularity is standard in PDE theory (especially for elliptic and parabolic equations with boundary conditions) and in geometric measure theory. It appears in classical results like the Gauss-Green theorem, divergence theorem with boundary integrals, and regularity theory for weak solutions."
