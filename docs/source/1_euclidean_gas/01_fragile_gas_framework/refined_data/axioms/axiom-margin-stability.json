  "core_assumption": "The mechanism determining a walker's alive/dead status is deterministically continuous and robust with respect to small changes in its projected position within the algorithmic space. The framework mandates the existence of a uniform \"safety margin\" or \"buffer\" $r_{\\mathrm{pos}}$ in the algorithmic space such that if a walker's position is perturbed by an amount whose average squared displacement is smaller than this margin, its survival status is guaranteed not to change. This provides a crucial stability guarantee, ensuring that infinitesimal positional noise cannot cause discrete, discontinuous status flips, which is essential for the continuity of all downstream operators that depend on the set of alive walkers.",

Without a guaranteed margin, the system becomes pathologically sensitive. Operators that depend on the set of alive walkers (e.g., aggregators, companion selectors, cloning operators) would experience discontinuous jumps in their inputs for arbitrarily small changes in walker positions, rendering their behavior unpredictable.",
      "algorithmic_instability": "The swarm's dynamics would be fundamentally unstable. The inherent noise from the perturbation step, even if small, could trigger non-trivial status changes ($n_c > 0$). This breaks the chain of reasoning for many continuity proofs in the framework, which rely on $n_c$ being zero for sufficiently small positional changes.",
      "invalidation_of_downstream_proofs": "As noted in the framework remark, this axiom is \"crucial to guarantee deterministic continuity of downstream operators.\" Its failure would invalidate the stability analysis for the entire pipeline, as the propagation of error could no longer be controlled. For example, the continuity of the fitness potential operator, which depends on stable aggregation, would be compromised.",
      "numerical_instability": "In computational simulations, the system would exhibit extreme sensitivity to small numerical errors or floating-point inaccuracies in walker positions. This could lead to erratic and unpredictable changes in swarm composition, making simulations unstable and results unreliable.",
      "compromised_debugging": "The axiom provides a clear separation of concerns: small positional changes should not cause status flips. Without it, it becomes impossible to distinguish status changes caused by meaningful walker movement from those caused by incidental noise near a decision boundary, making the system exceptionally difficult to tune and debug."
