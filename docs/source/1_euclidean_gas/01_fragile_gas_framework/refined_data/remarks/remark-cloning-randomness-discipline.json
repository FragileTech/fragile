  "content": "For each walker $i$, independently sample the cloning companion index $c_{\\text{clone}}(i)\\sim \\mathbb C_i(\\mathcal S)$ (with replacement) using an independent uniform $U_i^{\\mathrm{comp}}$.\n\nIndependently for each walker, draw the threshold $T_{\\text{clone},i}\\sim \\mathrm{Unif}(0,p_{\\max})$ using an independent uniform $U_i^{\\mathrm{clone}}$.\n\nThese choices ensure per‑walker independence in the cloning stage, consistent with Assumption A and the sampling policy in §7.1.1. Systematic resampling schemes that reuse a shared uniform are excluded from McDiarmid‑based analysis."
