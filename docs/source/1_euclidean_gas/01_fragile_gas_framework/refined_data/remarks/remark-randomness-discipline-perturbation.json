  "content": "For each walker $i$, sample the perturbation noise $\\xi_i$ independently from the chosen noise law (Gaussian, uniform ball, heat kernel, …), using a per‑walker PRNG stream. If the noise scale $\\sigma$ is adapted from $\\mathcal S_t$, the mapping $\\sigma(\\mathcal S_t)$ is deterministic; no shared, additional randomness is introduced at this stage. This enforces within‑step independence required by Assumption A."
