  "statement": "The **Cloning Score Function**, $S: \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, takes the fitness potential of a companion walker ($v_c$) and a primary walker ($v_i$) and computes a raw score.",
  "description": "This function computes a raw, unnormalized score that quantifies the relative fitness advantage of a companion walker over a primary walker. The score is regularized by a small constant epsilon in the denominator to prevent division by zero.",

      "description": "The score is the difference in fitness potentials, normalized by the primary walker's fitness potential (plus a regularizer)."
