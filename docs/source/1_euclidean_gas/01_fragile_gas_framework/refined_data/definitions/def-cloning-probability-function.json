  "statement": "The **Conditional Cloning Probability Function**, denoted $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\to [0, 1]$, maps the fitness potential of a companion ($v_c$) and a primary walker ($v_i$) to the probability that the \"Clone\" action is selected.",
  "description": "This function defines the probability of a 'Clone' action occurring based on the fitness potentials of two walkers (a companion and a primary walker). It is calculated by comparing the cloning score to a randomly drawn threshold, effectively clipping the normalized score to the valid probability range of [0, 1].",

      "formula": "\\pi(v_c, v_i) := P(S(v_c, v_i) > T_{\\text{clone}}) = \\min\\left(1, \\max\\left(0, \\frac{S(v_c, v_i)}{p_{\\max}}\\right)\\right)",
      "description": "The cloning probability is the probability that the score S(v_c, v_i) exceeds a uniform random threshold T_clone. This is equivalent to clipping the normalized score S(v_c, v_i) / p_max to the interval [0, 1]."
