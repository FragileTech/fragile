  "natural_language_statement": "The algorithmic space is extended to include a 'cemetery' point, denoted by a dagger, which represents the state of a dead walker. The distance from any valid point in the original space to this cemetery point is defined as a constant.",
  "description": "This definition formalizes the concept of a 'dead' walker by extending the metric space of walker states. By adding a unique cemetery point, we can canonically define the distance to a swarm of dead walkers (the cemetery law), which simplifies the analysis of swarm death and stability. The Wasserstein distance between any living swarm and the cemetery law becomes a fixed constant.",
