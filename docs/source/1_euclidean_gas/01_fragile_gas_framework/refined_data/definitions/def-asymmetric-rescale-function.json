  "description": "This definition provides a concrete example of a rescale function that satisfies the Axiom of a Well-Behaved Rescale Function. It is constructed in four parts to provide different behaviors for low, medium, and high standardized scores, while maintaining continuous differentiability everywhere. The cubic patch is essential for smoothly connecting the growth phase to the saturation phase.",
