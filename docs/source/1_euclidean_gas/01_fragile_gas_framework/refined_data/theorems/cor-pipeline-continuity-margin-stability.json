  "description": "This corollary shows that the Axiom of Margin-Based Status Stability is a sufficient condition to ensure the continuity of the fitness potential operator. It does so by guaranteeing that for sufficiently small perturbations of the swarm, there are no status changes (e.g., a walker becoming a companion or vice-versa), which eliminates the primary source of discontinuity.",

For small enough displacements ($d_{\\text{Disp},\\mathcal{Y}}(\\mathcal{S}_1,\\mathcal{S}_2)^2 \\le r_{\\mathrm{status}}$), the number of status changes $n_c=0$, and the unstable term in the continuity bound vanishes exactly.",
