  "formal_statement": "$$\n\\kappa^2_{\\text{variance}} = N \\cdot D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2\n$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the total number of walkers and $D_{\\mathcal{Y}}$ is the diameter of the algorithmic space.",
  "proof_sketch": "1. Decompose the total variance: By linearity of expectation, the total variance is the sum of individual walker variances.\n2. Bound the variance of a single component:\n   - If walker i is dead: variance is 0 (distance is deterministically 0)\n   - If walker i is alive: The distance is bounded on $[0, D_{\\mathcal{Y}}]$, so $\\text{Var}(d_i) \\le \\mathbb{E}[d_i^2] \\le D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2$\n3. Sum over all N walkers: Each term is bounded by $D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2$, so the total is bounded by $N \\cdot D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2$.",
