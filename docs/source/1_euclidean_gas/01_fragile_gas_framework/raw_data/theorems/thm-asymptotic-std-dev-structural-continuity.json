  "statement": "Let the chosen swarm aggregation operator $M$ have structural growth exponents $p_{\\mu,S}$ and $p_{m_2,S}$ for its mean and second moment, respectively, as defined in def-swarm-aggregation-operator-axiomatic. Let $L_{\\sigma',S}(\\mathcal{S})$ be the structural Lipschitz function for the regularized standard deviation, as derived in lem-stats-structural-continuity.\n\nThe asymptotic behavior of this function for large swarm size $k = |\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})|$ is determined by the larger of the two structural growth exponents. Let the worst-case exponent be:\n\n$$\np_{\\text{worst-case}} := \\max(p_{\\mu,S}, p_{m_2,S})\n$$\n\nThen, for large $k$, the structural Lipschitz function for the standard deviation is governed by this worst-case exponent:\n\n$$\nL_{\\sigma',S}(k) \\propto k^{p_{\\text{worst-case}}}\n$$",
  "proof_sketch": "The proof proceeds by analyzing the asymptotic form of the bound for the structural Lipschitz constant of the regularized standard deviation. From lem-stats-structural-continuity, $L_{\\sigma',S}(\\mathcal{S}) \\le (L_{m_2,S}(\\mathcal{S}) + 2V_{\\max}L_{\\mu,S}(\\mathcal{S}))/(2\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{std}})$. Since the numerator is a sum of power-law terms, the asymptotic behavior is dominated by the term with the largest exponent, yielding the result.",
