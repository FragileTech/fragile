Let $L_{\\sigma',S}(\\mathcal{S})$ be the structural Lipschitz function for the regularized standard deviation, as derived in [](#lem-stats-structural-continuity).\nThe asymptotic behavior of this function for large swarm size $k = |\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})|$ is determined by the larger of the two structural growth exponents. Let the worst-case exponent be:\n\n$$\np_{\\text{worst-case}} := \\max(p_{\\mu,S}, p_{m_2,S})\n$$\n\nThen, for large $k$, the structural Lipschitz function for the standard deviation is governed by this worst-case exponent:\n\n$$\nL_{\\sigma',S}(k) \\propto k^{p_{\\text{worst-case}}}\n$$",
