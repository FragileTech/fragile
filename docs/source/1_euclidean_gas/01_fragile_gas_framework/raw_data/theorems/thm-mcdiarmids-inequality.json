  "statement": "Let $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N$ be a set of independent random variables. Let $f$ be a function of these variables, $f(X_1, \\dots, X_N)$, that satisfies the **bounded differences property**. This means that for each variable $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, there exists a constant $c_i$ such that if only the $i$-th variable is changed, the function's value cannot change by more than $c_i$:\n$$\\sup_{x_1, \\dots, x_N, x'_i} |f(x_1, \\dots, x_i, \\dots, x_N) - f(x_1, \\dots, x'_i, \\dots, x_N)| \\le c_i$$\nThen for any $t > 0$, the probability that the function's value deviates from its expected value by more than $t$ is bounded by:\n$$P(|f(X_1, \\dots, X_N) - \\mathbb{E}[f(X_1, \\dots, X_N)]| \\ge t) \\le 2\\exp\\left(\\frac{-2t^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i^2}\\right)$$",
