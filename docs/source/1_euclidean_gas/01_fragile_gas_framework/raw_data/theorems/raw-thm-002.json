  "full_statement_text": "The continuity of the **N-Dimensional Standardization Operator** $z(\\mathcal{S})$ depends on the coupled effects of two distinct error sources whose expected growth rates are summed.\n\n*   **Core Principle:** The total **expected** squared error in the standardization operator's output, $\\mathbb{E}[\\| \\mathbf{z}_1 - \\mathbf{z}_2 \\|_2^2]$, is bounded by the sum of the **Expected Squared Value Error** ($E^2_{V,ms}$) and the **Expected Squared Structural Error** ($E^2_{S,ms}$). \n\n*   **Mathematical Result (General Form):** For a large number of alive walkers, $k_1 = |\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_1)|$, the total expected error has an asymptotic growth rate given by the sum of the growth rates of its two components:\n\n\n\n$$ \n\\boxed{\n    \\mathbb{E}[\\| \\mathbf{z}_1 - \\mathbf{z}_2 \\|_2^2] \\in O(E_{V,ms}^2(k_1)) + O(E_{S,ms}^2(k_1))\n    }\n$$\n\n*   **Implications & Failure Modes:** The overall mean-square continuity of the standardization pipeline is governed by the operational regime of the swarm. The analysis reveals a critical distinction between normal operation and catastrophic collapse.",
