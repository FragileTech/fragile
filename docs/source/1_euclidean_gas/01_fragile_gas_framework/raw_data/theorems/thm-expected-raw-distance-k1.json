  "title": "Deterministic Behavior of the Expected Raw Distance Vector at k=1",
  "statement_type": "theorem",
  "statement": "Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be a swarm state with exactly one alive walker, $|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})| = 1$. The N-dimensional vector of expected raw distances, $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S})]$, is deterministically the zero vector.",
  "formal_statement": "$$\n|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})| = 1 \\implies \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S})] = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\n**Implication for Continuity:**\n\nAny transition between a state $\\mathcal{S}_1$ with $|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_1)| \\ge 2$ and a state $\\mathcal{S}_2$ with $|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_2)| = 1$ induces a discontinuous change in the expected raw distance vector. The magnitude of this change is not governed by the Lipschitz bounds derived for the $k \\geq 2$ regime, but is instead given by the norm of the vector in the $k \\geq 2$ state:\n\n$$\n\\| \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S}_1)] - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S}_2)] \\|_2^2 = \\| \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S}_1)] \\|_2^2\n$$",
  "proof_sketch": "1. For the single alive walker j, the companion selection measure makes it its own companion: $c(j) = j$.\n2. The expected distance is thus $\\mathbb{E}[d_j(\\mathcal{S})] = d_{\\text{alg}}(x_j, x_j) = 0$ (metric property).\n3. For all dead walkers, the raw value is defined to be 0.\n4. Therefore, all components of $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S})]$ are zero.\n5. The discontinuity at the k=1 boundary is handled by the revival dynamics rather than the continuity framework.",

This singularity is fundamental to the algorithm's behavior and cannot be eliminated through continuity analysis. It motivates the need for special revival mechanisms.",
