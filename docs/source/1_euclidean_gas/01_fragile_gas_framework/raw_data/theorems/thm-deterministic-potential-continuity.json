  "name": "Deterministic Continuity of the Fitness Potential Operator",
  "statement": "Let the Fitness Potential Operator $V_{\\text{op}}$ be constructed using the patched **N-Dimensional Standardization Operator**. Let $(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathbf{v}_{r1}, \\mathbf{v}_{d1})$ and $(\\mathcal{S}_2, \\mathbf{v}_{r2}, \\mathbf{v}_{d2})$ be two sets of inputs, consisting of swarm states and their corresponding raw reward and distance vectors. Let $\\mathbf{V}_1$ and $\\mathbf{V}_2$ be the resulting N-dimensional fitness potential vectors. The squared Euclidean error between the output potential vectors is deterministically bounded by a function of the swarm displacement and the raw value differences: $\\|\\mathbf{V}_1 - \\mathbf{V}_2\\|_2^2 \\le F_{\\text{pot,det}}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2, \\mathbf{v}_{r1}, \\mathbf{v}_{r2}, \\mathbf{v}_{d1}, \\mathbf{v}_{d2})$ where $F_{\\text{pot,det}}$ is a deterministic bounding function that is jointly continuous in its arguments and vanishes as $d_{\\text{Disp},\\mathcal{Y}}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2) \\to 0$, $\\|\\mathbf{v}_{r1} - \\mathbf{v}_{r2}\\|_2 \\to 0$, and $\\|\\mathbf{v}_{d1} - \\mathbf{v}_{d2}\\|_2 \\to 0$.",
  "proof_sketch": "The proof proceeds by deterministically decomposing the total error into contributions from unstable walkers (whose status changes) and stable walkers. The error from unstable walkers is bounded deterministically by $V_{\\text{pot,max}}^2 \\cdot n_c(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)$. For stable walkers, the potential is a composite function of the standardized vectors, and using the Lipschitz continuity of the potential function, the error is bounded by a linear combination of the squared errors of the underlying standardization pipelines. We then substitute the deterministic bound from the global continuity theorem for patched standardization and assemble the final bound $F_{\\text{pot,det}}$.",
