  "name": "Theorem of Guaranteed Revival from a Single Survivor",
  "status": "extracted",
  "statement": "Let $\\mathcal{S}_t$ be a swarm state with exactly one alive walker, such that $|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_t)| = 1$. Let the index of this single survivor be $j$, so $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_t) = \\{j\\}$. Assume the **Axiom of Guaranteed Revival** holds, such that the revival score ratio $\\kappa_{\\text{revival}} > 1$. Then, the one-step transition $\\mathcal{S}_t \\to \\mathcal{S}_{t+1}$ is characterized by the following three properties with probability 1:\n\n1. **Survivor Persistence:** The single alive walker $j$ will be assigned the \"Persist\" action. Its intermediate position will be its current position, $x_j^{(t+0.5)} = x_j^{(t)}$. Its subsequent evolution is that of a single, persistent random walker for the remainder of the timestep.\n\n2. **Dead Walker Revival:** Every dead walker $i \\in \\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{S}_t)$ (for $i \\neq j$) will be assigned the \"Clone\" action. Its intermediate position $x_i^{(t+0.5)}$ will be sampled from the **Cloning Measure** centered on the survivor's position, $\\mathcal{Q}_\\delta(x_j^{(t)}, \\cdot)$.\n\n3. **Swarm Revival and Failure Condition:** The swarm is guaranteed to enter the intermediate state $\\mathcal{S}_{t+0.5}$ with all $N$ walkers alive ($|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_{t+0.5})| = N$). The risk of swarm extinction ($|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S}_{t+1})|=0$) is therefore isolated to the single, simultaneous event where all $N$ walkers in the revived intermediate swarm independently move to an invalid state during the final perturbation and status update phase.",
