    "full_statement_text": "Let S_t be a swarm state with exactly one alive walker, such that |A(S_t)| = 1. Let the index of this single survivor be j, so A(S_t) = {j}.\nAssume the **Axiom of Guaranteed Revival ([](#def-axiom-guaranteed-revival))** holds, such that the revival score ratio kappa_{revival} > 1.\nThen, the one-step transition S_t -> S_{t+1} is characterized by the following three properties with probability 1:\n1.  **Survivor Persistence:** The single alive walker j will be assigned the \"Persist\" action. Its intermediate position will be its current position, x_j^{(t+0.5)} = x_j^{(t)}. Its subsequent evolution is that of a single, persistent random walker for the remainder of the timestep.\n2.  **Dead Walker Revival:** Every dead walker i in D(S_t) (for i != j) will be assigned the \"Clone\" action. Its intermediate position x_i^{(t+0.5)} will be sampled from the **Cloning Measure** centered on the survivor's position, Q_delta(x_j^{(t)}, .).\n3.  **Swarm Revival and Failure Condition:** The swarm is guaranteed to enter the intermediate state S_{t+0.5} with all N walkers alive (|A(S_{t+0.5})| = N). The risk of swarm extinction (|A(S_{t+1})|=0) is therefore isolated to the single, simultaneous event where all N walkers in the revived intermediate swarm independently move to an invalid state during the final perturbation and status update phase.",
