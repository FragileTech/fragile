This prevents aggregators from producing statistical moments that are pathologically decoupled from the input data.\n*   **Axiomatic Parameter ($\\kappa_{\\text{var}}$ - The Variance Deviation Factor):** The user must provide a constant $\\kappa_{\\text{var}} \\geq 1$ that bounds this relationship.\n*   **Condi",
