  "statement": "The expectation of the squared displacement caused by the **Perturbation Measure**, after being projected into the **Algorithmic Space**, is uniformly bounded across all possible starting positions.",
  "full_text": "**Core Assumption:** The expectation of the squared displacement caused by the **Perturbation Measure**, after being projected into the **Algorithmic Space**, is uniformly bounded across all possible starting positions. This ensures that, on average, walkers do not experience infinite displacement.\n\n**Axiomatic Parameter:** The user of this framework must provide one non-negative constant derived from their choice of operators:\n1. **$M_{\\text{pert}}^2$ (The Maximum Expected Squared Displacement):** An upper bound on the expectation of the squared displacement.\n\n**Condition:** For any starting position $x_{\\text{in}} \\in \\mathcal{X}$, let the random variable for the squared displacement be $Y := d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(\\varphi(x_{\\text{out}}), \\varphi(x_{\\text{in}}))^2$ where $x_{\\text{out}} \\sim \\mathcal{P}_\\sigma(x_{\\text{in}}, \\cdot)$. The constant must satisfy:\n$$M_{\\text{pert}}^2 \\ge \\sup_{x_{\\text{in}} \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\mathbb{E}[Y]$$\n\n**Framework Application:** This axiom provides a uniform bound on the *mean* of the random displacement. The *fluctuations* around this mean are bounded via **McDiarmid's inequality** for functions of independent inputs (Assumption A), applied to the average of per‑walker squared displacements. Bounded differences hold with constants $c_i=D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2/N$ since each term lies in $[0,D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2]$ (finite diameter). No further variance assumptions are required. See Boucheron–Lugosi–Massart (Appendix B).\n\n**Failure Mode Analysis:** If this axiom is violated (i.e., if the supremum is infinite), walkers could be displaced by an infinite amount on average, making the operator's behavior unpredictable and breaking the continuity guarantees.",
