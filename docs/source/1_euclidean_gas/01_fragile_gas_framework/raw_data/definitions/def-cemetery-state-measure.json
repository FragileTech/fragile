If $|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})| > 0$, $\\mu_{\\mathcal{S}}$ is the empirical or smoothed measure as defined in 5.1 and 5.2 (i.e., $\\mu_{\\mathcal{S}} = \\nu_{\\mathcal{S}}$ or $\\mu_{\\mathcal{S}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathcal{S}, \\ell}$).\n2.  If $|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})| = 0$, its representation is the unique **Cemetery State Measure**, denoted $\\mu_{\\mathcal{S}} := \\nu_{\\emptyset}$.\nThe Cemetery State Measure $\\nu_{\\emptyset}$ is an abstract object that does not have a density on $\\mathcal{Y}$. Its properties are defined entirely by its interaction with the distance functions used in the swarm metrics.",
