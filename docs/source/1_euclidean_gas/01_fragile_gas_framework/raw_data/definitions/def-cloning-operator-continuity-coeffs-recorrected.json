  "statement": "The state-dependent functions in the continuity bound for the Cloning Transition Operator are defined as follows:\n\n1. **The Cloning Lipschitz Amplification Factor ($C_{\\text{clone},L}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)$):** The coefficient of the term that is linear in the input squared displacement, $d_{\\text{Disp},\\mathcal{Y}}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)^2$. This term primarily captures the propagation of the positional component of the input displacement.\n\n2. **The Cloning Hölder Amplification Factor ($C_{\\text{clone},H}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)$):** The coefficient of the Hölder term, $d_{\\text{Disp},\\mathcal{Y}}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)$. This term arises from the complex, non-linear error propagation originating from the **Distance-to-Companion Measurement**, specifically from the component of its error bound that is quadratic in the number of status changes.\n\n3. **The Cloning Stochastic Offset ($K_{\\text{clone}}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)$):** A state-dependent term that is independent of the input displacement. It represents the baseline displacement introduced by the operator's intrinsic stochasticity, which exists even if the two input swarms are identical.",
