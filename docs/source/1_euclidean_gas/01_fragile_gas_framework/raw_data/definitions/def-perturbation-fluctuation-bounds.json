  "full_text": "The total random displacement introduced by the Perturbation Operator is bounded by the sum of two components: a deterministic bound on its mean and a probabilistic bound on its fluctuations.\n\n1. **The Mean Displacement Bound ($B_M(N)$):** A deterministic upper bound on the total expected squared displacement for a swarm of size N. It is derived from the **Axiom of Bounded Second Moment of Perturbation**.\n   $$B_M(N) := N \\cdot M_{\\text{pert}}^2$$\n\n2. **The Stochastic Fluctuation Bound ($B_S(N, \\delta')$):** A high-probability bound on the deviation of the total squared displacement from its mean, derived from McDiarmid's inequality. For a given failure probability $\\delta' \\in (0, 1)$, it is defined as:\n   $$B_S(N, \\delta') := D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{N}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{\\delta'}\\right)}$$\n   where $D_{\\mathcal{Y}}$ is the diameter of the algorithmic space.",
