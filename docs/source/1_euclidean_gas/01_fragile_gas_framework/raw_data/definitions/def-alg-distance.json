In practice, this is the distance or semidistance function $d_{\\mathcal{Y}}$ applied to the projected points in the algorithmic space:\n$$\n\n\\boxed{d_{\\text{alg}}(x_1, x_2) := d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(\\varphi(x_1), \\varphi(x_2))}\n\n$$\nThis is the practical implementation of the Wasserstein distance between the walkers' projected Dirac measures and serves as the ground distance for all subsequent calculations.",
