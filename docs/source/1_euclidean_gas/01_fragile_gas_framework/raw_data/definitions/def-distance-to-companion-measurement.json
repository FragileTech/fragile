  "full_text": "The distance value $d_i$ for walker $i$ is the result of a two-stage sampling process. First, a **potential companion** index, denoted $c_{\\text{pot}}(i)$, is sampled from the **Companion Selection Measure** $\\mathbb{C}_i$. Second, the **Algorithmic Distance** is computed to that specific companion.\n\nThis process is equivalent to sampling a single value from the **Distance-to-Companion Measure** $\\mathbb{D}_i$, which is the pushforward of $\\mathbb{C}_i$ by the distance function $D_i(j) = d_{\\text{alg}}(x_i, x_j)$.\n\n$$\nd_i := d_{\\text{alg}}(x_i, x_{c_{\\text{pot}}(i)}) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad c_{\\text{pot}}(i) \\sim \\mathbb{C}_i(\\cdot)\n$$\n\nThe **Raw Distance Vector Operator**, denoted $\\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S})$, maps a swarm state $\\mathcal{S}$ to a *distribution* over N-dimensional vectors. A single realization of this vector is produced by performing the distance-to-companion measurement independently for each alive walker. For dead walkers, the component is zero.",
