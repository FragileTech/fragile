  "full_text": "Let two walkers, $i$ and $j$, have their positions represented by the Dirac positional measures $\\delta_{x_i}$ and $\\delta_{x_j}$. The distance between them in the algorithmic space is the **1-Wasserstein distance ($W_1$)** between their **projected positional measures**, with $d_{\\mathcal{Y}}$ as the ground metric.\nThe projected positional measure for walker $i$ is the pushforward measure $\\varphi_* \\delta_{x_i} = \\delta_{\\varphi(x_i)}$. The distance is then:\n$$\n\nd(\\varphi_* \\delta_{x_i}, \\varphi_* \\delta_{x_j}) := W_1(\\delta_{\\varphi(x_i)}, \\delta_{\\varphi(x_j)})\n\n$$\nFor Dirac measures, the Wasserstein distance simplifies to the ground metric distance between their points of support.",
