  "full_text": "The Swarm Update Operator maps an input swarm at time t to a probability distribution over swarm states at time t+1. It is a composition of four sequential stages:\n\n1.  **Stage 1: Measurement Transition**: For a given input swarm, this stage produces a probability distribution over pairs of raw measurement vectors (reward and distance) for the set of alive walkers. This is the only stochastic part of the measurement process.\n\n2.  **Stage 2: Fitness Potential Calculation**: This stage is a deterministic map from the raw measurement vectors to a full N-dimensional fitness potential vector. It involves two steps: calculating a potential vector for the alive set, and then assembling the full vector.\n\n3.  **Stage 3: Cloning Transition**: This stage maps the input swarm and the fixed potential vector to a distribution over an intermediate swarm state. For each walker, it samples a cloning companion, determines a cloning or persisting action, and samples an intermediate position based on that action.\n\n4.  **Stage 4: Perturbation and Final Status Update**: The final swarm state is generated by applying a perturbation operator to the intermediate swarm's positions, followed by a deterministic status update operator to determine the final aliveness of each walker.",
