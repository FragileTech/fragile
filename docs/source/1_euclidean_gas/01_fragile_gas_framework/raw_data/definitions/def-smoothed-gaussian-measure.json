  "content": "The creation of a smoothed measure requires a key analytical parameter:\n*   **Smoothed Measure Kernel Scale ($\\ell$):** The length scale (standard deviation), $\\ell > 0$, of the Gaussian kernel used for smoothing. A larger $\\ell$ results in a smoother, less detailed density estimate.\nLet $K_\\ell(y, y')$ be a Gaussian kernel with length scale $\\ell$. The **smoothed Gaussian measure**, denoted $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathcal{S}, \\ell}$, is the probability measure whose density is given by:\n$$\n\n\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\mathcal{S}, \\ell}(y) := \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{S})} K_\\ell(y, \\varphi(x_i))\n\n$$\nThis representation provides a smooth, differentiable approximation of the swarm's distribution in the algorithmic space and is the foundation for the $d_{\\Sigma_N, L_2}$ distance.",
