  "full_text": "The name \"Fragile\" reflects the algorithm's fundamental property: walkers are fragile entities that can die (status $s=0$) when they violate environmental constraints. This fragility is not a weakness but the *source of adaptation*. Dead walkers mark dangerous regions, and the cloning operator reallocates computational resources away from these regions toward successful paths. The framework proves this fragile-plus-revival architecture is mathematically sound and guarantees long-term viability.",
