  "full_text": "For any walker $i$, by applying the triangle inequality to the distance $d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(\\varphi(x'_{1,i}), \\varphi(x'_{2,i}))$ using the input positions as intermediate points, and then using the inequality $(a+b+c)^2 \\le 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$, we get the following bound on the squared distance for the $i$-th walker:\n$$d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(\\varphi(x'_{1,i}), \\varphi(x'_{2,i}))^2 \\le 3 d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(\\varphi(x'_{1,i}), \\varphi(x_{1,i}))^2 + 3 d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(\\varphi(x_{1,i}), \\varphi(x_{2,i}))^2 + 3 d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(\\varphi(x_{2,i}), \\varphi(x'_{2,i}))^2$$\n\nSumming this inequality over all $N$ walkers and recognizing that the sum of the middle terms is $\\Delta_{\\text{pos}}^2(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)$ and the sums of the outer terms are the definitions of $\\Delta_{\\text{pert}}^2(\\mathcal{S}_1)$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{pert}}^2(\\mathcal{S}_2)$ yields the stated result. This decomposition is a purely algebraic consequence of the triangle inequality and holds regardless of any statistical dependency.",
