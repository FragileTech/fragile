  "proof_text": "The proof constructs a high-probability bound for the output displacement metric by composing the algebraic and probabilistic bounds from the preceding lemmas.\n\n1. **Decomposition of the Output Metric.**\n   The squared N-Particle Displacement Metric for the output swarms is:\n   $$d_{\\text{Disp},\\mathcal{Y}}(\\mathcal{S}'_1, \\mathcal{S}'_2)^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\Delta_{\\text{pos}}^2(\\mathcal{S}'_1, \\mathcal{S}'_2) + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{status}}}{N} n_c(\\mathcal{S}'_1, \\mathcal{S}'_2)$$\n\n2. **Bound the Components.**\n   The Perturbation Operator does not alter the survival status of any walker, so the status change term is deterministic. The output positional displacement is bounded by the lemma on bounding output positional displacement.\n\n3. **Construct a Probabilistic Bound.**\n   The random variables $\\Delta_{\\text{pert}}^2(\\mathcal{S}_1)$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{pert}}^2(\\mathcal{S}_2)$ are independent. We use the **union bound** to establish a simultaneous high-probability bound for both terms, allocating a failure probability of $\\delta' = \\delta/2$ to each. Both bounds hold simultaneously with probability at least $1-\\delta$.\n\n4. **Combine All Bounds.**\n   Substituting the deterministic bound for the status component and the high-probability bound for the positional component back into the metric definition gives the final result as stated in the theorem.",
