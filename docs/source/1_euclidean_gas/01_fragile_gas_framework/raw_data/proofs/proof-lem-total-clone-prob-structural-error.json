  "proof_text": "The structural error is $|E_V_1[P_1,i(V_1) - P_2,i(V_1)]|$. By Jensen's inequality, this is $\\leq E_V_1[|P_1,i(V_1) - P_2,i(V_1)|]$. From thm-expected-cloning-action-continuity, the term inside the expectation is bounded by $C_{\\text{struct}}^{(π)}(k_1) \\cdot n_c$. Since this bound is a deterministic constant, its expectation is the bound itself.",
