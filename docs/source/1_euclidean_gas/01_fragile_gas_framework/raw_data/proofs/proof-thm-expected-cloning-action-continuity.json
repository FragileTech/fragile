  "proof_text": "The proof decomposes the total error into a structural component and a value component using the triangle inequality:\n$|E_1[π_1] - E_2[π_2]| \\leq |E_1[π_1] - E_1[π_2]| + |E_1[π_2] - E_2[π_2]|$.\n\n1. **Bound the Value Error Component:** The first term is the error from the change in potentials for a fixed companion measure. Using Jensen's inequality and the Lipschitz continuity of $\\pi$ (lem-cloning-probability-lipschitz), this is bounded by $C_{val}^{(π)}$ times the sum of the expected companion potential change and the walker's own potential change.\n\n2. **Bound the Structural Error Component:** The second term is the error from the change in the companion measure for a fixed potential vector. We apply the **Total Error Bound in Terms of Status Changes (thm-total-error-status-bound)**. The function being evaluated is bounded by $M_f=1$. The size of the initial companion set is at least $max(1, k_1-1)$. This gives the bound $C_{\\text{struct}}^{(π)}(k_1) \\cdot n_c$.\n\nSumming the two bounds gives the final result.",
