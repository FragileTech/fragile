  "proof_text": "The proof proceeds by finding the Lipschitz constant of the composition of the **clip** function and the normalized score function, $S(v_c, v_i)/p_{\\max}$. The **clip** function (min(1, max(0, x))) has a Lipschitz constant of 1. Therefore, the Lipschitz constant of $\\pi$ is bounded by the Lipschitz constant of the normalized score. We find this by bounding the partial derivatives of the score function $S(v_c, v_i)$.\n\n1. **Partial Derivative with respect to $v_c$:** $\\partial S/\\partial v_c = 1/(v_i + \\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}})$. For alive walkers, lem-potential-boundedness gives $v_i\\ge V_{\\text{pot,min}}$, hence the bound $1/(V_{\\text{pot,min}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}})$. For a dead walker ($v_i=0$), the bound is $1/\\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}}$. The worst case is the dead‑walker value $1/\\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}}$.\n\n2. **Partial Derivative with respect to $v_i$:** $\\partial S/\\partial v_i = (-\\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}} - v_c)/(v_i + \\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}})^2$. In magnitude, this is $\\le (V_{\\text{pot,max}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}})/(v_i + \\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}})^2$. For alive walkers, use $v_i\\ge V_{\\text{pot,min}}$; for a dead walker, $v_i=0$ yields the worst‑case bound $(V_{\\text{pot,max}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}})/\\varepsilon_{\\text{clone}}^2$.\n\n3. **Combine:** Divide the worst‑case partial‑derivative bounds by $p_{\\max}$ to obtain the stated uniform Lipschitz constants $L_{\\pi,c}$ and $L_{\\pi,i}$ that cover both alive and dead cases.",
