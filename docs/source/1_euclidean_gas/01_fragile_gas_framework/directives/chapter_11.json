Let $\\mathbf{d}_1 = \\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S}_1)$ and $\\mathbf{d}_2 = \\mathbf{d}(\\mathcal{S}_2)$.\n2738: 1.  **Decomposition of Total Error:**\n2739:     We introduce the expectation vectors $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]$ and use the inequality $\\|A+B+C\\|_2^2 \\le 3(\\|A\\|_2^2 + \\|B\\|_2^2 + \\|C\\|_2^2)$.\n2740: $$\n2741: \n2742:     \\|\\mathbf{d}_1 - \\mathbf{d}_2\\|_2^2 = \\|(\\mathbf{d}_1 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1]) + (\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1] - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]) - (\\mathbf{d}_2 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2])\\|_2^2\n2743: \n2744: \n2745: $$\n2746: $$\n2747:     \\le 3\\|\\mathbf{d}_1 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1]\\|_2^2 + 3\\|\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1] - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]\\|_2^2 + 3\\|\\mathbf{d}_2 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]\\|_2^2\n2748:     $$\n2749: 2.  **Take the Expectation:**\n2750:     We take the expectation of both sides. By linearity of expectation, this gives:\n2751: $$\n2752: \n2753:     \\mathbb{E}[\\|\\mathbf{d}_1 - \\mathbf{d}_2\\|_2^2] \\le 3\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\mathbf{d}_1 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1]\\|_2^2] + 3\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1] - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]\\|_2^2] + 3\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\mathbf{d}_2 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]\\|_2^2]\n2754: \n2755: \n2756: $$\n2757: 3.  **Bound the Components:**\n2758:     *   **Stochastic Variance Terms:** The first and third terms are bounded by the **Axiom of Bounded Measurement Variance**, which we have shown is satisfied by the distance operator in [](#thm-distance-operator-satisfies-bounded-variance-axiom) with $\\kappa^2_{\\text{variance}} = N D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2$. Therefore:\n2759:         *   $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\mathbf{d}_1 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1]\\|_2^2] \\le N D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2$\n2760:         *   $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\mathbf{d}_2 - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]\\|_2^2] \\le N D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2$\n2761:     *   **Deterministic Mean Term:** The middle term involves the squared norm of a deterministic vector difference, so the expectation has no effect. This term is bounded by the analysis in Section 10.3. From [](#thm-distance-operator-mean-square-continuity), we have:\n2762: $$\n2763: \n2764:         \\|\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_1] - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{d}_2]\\|_2^2 \\le C_{\\text{pos},d} \\cdot \\Delta_{\\text{pos}}^2 + C_{\\text{status},d}^{(1)} \\cdot n_c + C_{\\text{status},d}^{(2)}(k_1) \\cdot n_c^2\n2765: \n2766: \n2767: $$\n2768: 4.  **Combine the Bounds:**\n2769:     Substituting the bounds from Step 3 into the inequality from Step 2 yields the final result:\n2770: $$\n2771: \n2772:     \\mathbb{E}[\\|\\mathbf{d}_1 - \\mathbf{d}_2\\|_2^2] \\le 3(N D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2) + 3(\\text{Bound from Thm 10.3.2}) + 3(N D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2)\n2773: \n2774: \n2775: $$\n2776: This simplifies to the expression for $F_{d,ms}(\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2)$ as stated in the theorem.\n2777: **Q.E.D.**"
