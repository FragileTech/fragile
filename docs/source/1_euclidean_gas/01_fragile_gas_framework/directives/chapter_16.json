This will be absorbed into the final offset, $K_P$. The core of the proof is to bound the first term, which is the L1-norm of the difference between the total cloning probability vectors, $\\|\\Delta \\overline{\\mathbf{P}}\\|_1$.\n4975: 2.  **Bound the L1-Norm of the Probability Difference.**\n4976:     From the continuity of the total expected cloning action ([](#thm-total-expected-cloning-action-continuity)), we have a bound for each component, which we sum over all **N** walker ({prf:ref}`def-walker`)s:\n4977: \n4978: $$\n4979: \n4980:     \\|\\Delta \\overline{\\mathbf{P}}\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^N |\\overline{P}_{\\text{clone}}(\\mathcal{S}_1)_i - \\overline{P}_{\\text{clone}}(\\mathcal{S}_2)_i| \\le \\sum_{i=1}^N (E_{\\text{struct}}^{(\\overline{P})} + E_{\\text{val}}^{(\\overline{P})})\n4981: \n4982: $$\n4983: *   The structural error term from [](#lem-total-clone-prob-structural-error) is bounded by $N \\cdot C_{\\text{struct}}^{(\\pi)}(k_1) \\cdot n_c$.\n4984:     *   The value error term from [](#lem-total-clone-prob-value-error) is bounded by $N \\cdot C_{\\text{val}}^{(\\pi)} \\sqrt{2N \\cdot F_{\\text{pot}}}$.\n4985: 3.  **Substitute the Bound for the Fitness Potential Error ($F_{\\text{pot}}$).**\n4986:     The crucial step is to substitute the bound for the **Expected Squared Potential Error Bound** ($F_{\\text{pot}}$) from [](#thm-fitness-potential-mean-square-continuity). $F_{\\text{pot}}$ is itself a function of the input displacement components: $F_{\\text{pot}}(S_1, S_2) = F_unstable + F_{\\text{stable}}$, where $F_{\\text{stable}}$ is bounded by the mean-square errors of the standardization pipelines for reward and distance.
