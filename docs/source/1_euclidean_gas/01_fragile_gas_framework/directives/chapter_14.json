Probabilistic Bound on Total Perturbation-Induced Displacement\n4108: :::{prf:lemma} Probabilistic Bound on Total Perturbation-Induced Displacement\n4109: :label: lem-sub-probabilistic-bound-perturbation-displacement-reproof\n4110: Let $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{in}}$ be an input swarm. Assume the **Axiom of Bounded Second Moment of Perturbation** ([](#def-axiom-bounded-second-moment-perturbation)) holds. Then for any probability of failure $\\delta' \\in (0, 1)$, the **Total Perturbation-Induced Displacement** is bounded with probability at least $1-\\delta'$:\n4111: $$\n4112: \n4113: \\Delta_{\\text{pert}}^2(\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{in}}) \\le B_M(N) + B_S(N, \\delta')\n4114: \n4115: $$\n4116: where $B_M(N)$ is the **Mean Displacement Bound** and $B_S(N, \\delta')$ is the **Stochastic Fluctuation Bound**, as defined in the subsequent section.\n4117: :::\n4118: :::{prf:proof}\n4119: :label: proof-lem-sub-probabilistic-bound-perturbation-displacement-reproof\n4120: \n4121: **Proof.**\n4122: The proof proceeds by applying McDiarmid's Inequality to the function that computes the total perturbation-induced displacement.\n4123: 1.  **Define the Function and Independent Variables.**\n4124:     *   **Independent Variables:** The perturbation of the N-particle swarm is the result of **N** independent random choices made by the perturbation measure for each walker.\n4125:     *   **Function:** The function we wish to bound is the **Total Perturbation-Induced Displacement**, **f**, which is a function of these **N** independent random choices for a fixed initial state $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{in}}$.\n4126: 2.  **Prove the Bounded Differences Property.**\n4127:     We apply McDiarmid to $f_{\\text{avg}}$. Changing only the **i**-th random outcome only affects the **i**-th summand. Since each summand is in $[0, D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2]$, the bounded differences constants are $c_i = D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2/N$ for all $i$.\n4128: 3.  **Apply McDiarmid's Inequality and Solve for the Bound.**\n4129:     The sum of squares is $\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i^2 = N\\,(D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^2/N)^2 = D_{\\mathcal{Y}}^4/N$. McDiarmid yields, for $t>0$,\n4130: $$"
