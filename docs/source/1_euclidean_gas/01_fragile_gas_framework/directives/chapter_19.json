Fragile Gas: The Algorithm's Execution\n5212: The preceding sections have defined all the necessary mathematical objects, operators, and axiomatic constraints that constitute the Fragile framework. This final section formally defines the algorithm's execution, describing how the one-step **Swarm Update Operator** is used to evolve a swarm over time."
