The subsequent sections provide two distinct examples of valid functions: an asymmetric piecewise function and a canonical logistic function, along with proofs that they satisfy this axiom.

Its minimum value on the interval $s \\in [0,1]$ must occur at $s=0$, which gives $T(0,x)=1$. Since the term $T(s,x)$ is always greater than or equal to 1, and the factor $(1-s)$ is non-negative on the domain, the entire partial derivative is non-negative: $\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} \\ge 0$. This proves that for any fixed $s$, the function $q(s,x)$ is monotonically increasing with $x$.\n1975:     *   **Finding the Supremum:** Because $q(s,x)$ is increasing in $x$, its supremum over the domain must occur at the boundary where $x \\to 1$ (which corresponds to $z_{\\max} \\to 1^+$).

Since this vertex lies within the interval $[0,1]$, the maximum of the function is the value at this vertex.
