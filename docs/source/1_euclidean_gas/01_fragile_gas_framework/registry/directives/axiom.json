The user is responsible for proving that their chosen function complies with these conditions.\n1637: *   **1. $C^1$ Smoothness:** The function $g_A(z)$ must be continuously differentiable on its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}$. This ensures that the fitness potential is a smooth function of the standardized scores, which is critical for the stability of the cloning dynamics.\n1638: *   **2. Monotonicity:** The function must be monotonically non-decreasing. This is equivalent to its first derivative being non-negative for all inputs:\n1639: $$\n1640: \n1641:     g'_A(z) \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall z \\in \\mathbb{R}\n1642: \n1643: \n1644: $$\n1645: This property is essential to guarantee that a higher (better) standardized score never results in a lower fitness potential component.\n1646: *   **3.

This prevents the fitness potential from becoming infinite, which is a non-negotiable requirement for the stability of the selection and cloning operators.\n1647: *   **4. Global Lipschitz Continuity:** The function must be globally Lipschitz continuous. For a $C^1$ function, this is equivalent to its first derivative being uniformly bounded.
