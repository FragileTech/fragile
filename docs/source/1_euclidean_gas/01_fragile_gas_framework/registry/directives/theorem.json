The system's stability is dominated by the value error, which is **constant with respect to swarm size** and scales with $1/\\sigma'^2_{\\min,\\text{bound}}$ and $L_{\\sigma\\'_{\\text{reg}}}^2/\\sigma'^4_{\\min,\\text{bound}}$. When the variance floor is much smaller than the smoothing parameter ($\\kappa_{\\text{var,min}} \\ll \\varepsilon_{\\text{std}}^2$), this reduces to the familiar $O(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{std}}^{-6})$ sensitivity.\n3438: 2.  **Regime 2: Catastrophic Collapse.**\n3439:     If a significant fraction of the swarm dies, such that $n_c \\propto k_1$, then the total error **grows linearly with the initial swarm size** with coefficients proportional to $L_{\\sigma\\'_{\\text{reg}}}^2/\\sigma'^4_{\\min,\\text{bound}}$.

By ensuring the denominator of the standardization formula is a globally Lipschitz function of the raw value variance, the pathological sensitivity near zero-variance states is eliminated. This, in turn, enables a deterministic, worst-case **global continuity with a Lipschitz–Hölder modulus** for the entire N-Dimensional Standardization Operator.\n3442: This property is a non-negotiable prerequisite for certain powerful long-term convergence results, such as those derived from Feynman-Kac particle system theory. The following sections provide a rigorous, self-contained proof of this property. The strategy is to deterministically decompose the total error vector, $\\Deltaz = z(S_1, v_1, M) - z(S_2, v_2, M)$, into a series of manageable components and to bound the L2-norm of each component by a term proportional to the N-Particle Displacement Metric and the L2-norm of the raw value difference.\n3443: #### 11.3.1 Theorem: Decomposition of the Total Standardization Error\n3444: To establish the joint Lipschitz continuity of the standardization operator with respect to both the swarm state **S** and the raw value vector **v**, we first decompose the total squared error into two distinct components: a **Value Error** arising from the change in the raw value vector for a fixed swarm structure, and a **Structural Error** arising from the change in the swarm structure for a fixed raw value vector.\n3445: :::{prf:theorem} Decomposition of the Total Standardization Error\n3446: :label: thm-deterministic-error-decomposition\n3447: Let $z(S, v, M)$ be the N-Dimensional Standardization Operator.

      "raw_directive": "3434: ##### 11.2.4.3. Implications and Interpretation\n3435: This result reveals two distinct operational regimes:\n3436: 1.  **Regime 1: Normal Operation (Low Attrition).**\n3437:     If the number of status changes $n_c$ is small, the structural error terms are bounded or vanish for large $k_1$. The system's stability is dominated by the value error, which is **constant with respect to swarm size** and scales with $1/\\sigma'^2_{\\min,\\text{bound}}$ and $L_{\\sigma\\'_{\\text{reg}}}^2/\\sigma'^4_{\\min,\\text{bound}}$. When the variance floor is much smaller than the smoothing parameter ($\\kappa_{\\text{var,min}} \\ll \\varepsilon_{\\text{std}}^2$), this reduces to the familiar $O(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{std}}^{-6})$ sensitivity.\n3438: 2.  **Regime 2: Catastrophic Collapse.**\n3439:     If a significant fraction of the swarm dies, such that $n_c \\propto k_1$, then the total error **grows linearly with the initial swarm size** with coefficients proportional to $L_{\\sigma\\'_{\\text{reg}}}^2/\\sigma'^4_{\\min,\\text{bound}}$. In the $\\kappa_{\\text{var,min}} \\ll \\varepsilon_{\\text{std}}^2$ regime this again matches the $O(k_1\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{std}}^{-6})$ scaling.\n3440: ### 11.3 Deterministic Lipschitz Continuity of the Patched Standardization Operator\n3441: The introduction of the **Regularized Standard Deviation Function** ([](#def-statistical-properties-measurement)) ($\\sigma\\'_{\\text{reg}}$) in Section 11.1.2 provides a critical stability guarantee that is stronger than mean-square continuity. By ensuring the denominator of the standardization formula is a globally Lipschitz function of the raw value variance, the pathological sensitivity near zero-variance states is eliminated. This, in turn, enables a deterministic, worst-case **global continuity with a Lipschitz–Hölder modulus** for the entire N-Dimensional Standardization Operator.\n3442: This property is a non-negotiable prerequisite for certain powerful long-term convergence results, such as those derived from Feynman-Kac particle system theory. The following sections provide a rigorous, self-contained proof of this property. The strategy is to deterministically decompose the total error vector, $\\Deltaz = z(S_1, v_1, M) - z(S_2, v_2, M)$, into a series of manageable components and to bound the L2-norm of each component by a term proportional to the N-Particle Displacement Metric and the L2-norm of the raw value difference.\n3443: #### 11.3.1 Theorem: Decomposition of the Total Standardization Error\n3444: To establish the joint Lipschitz continuity of the standardization operator with respect to both the swarm state **S** and the raw value vector **v**, we first decompose the total squared error into two distinct components: a **Value Error** arising from the change in the raw value vector for a fixed swarm structure, and a **Structural Error** arising from the change in the swarm structure for a fixed raw value vector.\n3445: :::{prf:theorem} Decomposition of the Total Standardization Error\n3446: :label: thm-deterministic-error-decomposition\n3447: Let $z(S, v, M)$ be the N-Dimensional Standardization Operator.
