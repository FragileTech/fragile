    "summary": "The proof assumes a high-contribution outlier lies on the 'near side' of its swarm center (toward the opposing swarm) and derives a contradiction through geometric impossibility. Key steps: (1) Invoke lem-nearest-center-approximation to establish that swarm membership requires proximity to own center, yielding r < L/2. (2) Derive explicit radius bound R_I(ε) ≥ sqrt(τ_H(ε)/k_min) from def-unified-high-low-error-sets contribution threshold, where τ_H is the high-error contribution threshold and k_min is the minimum cluster size. (3) Use separation hypothesis to show R_I > L/2 + R_J, creating the contradiction r ≥ R_I > L/2 vs r < L/2. (4) Quantify slack δ_geo(ε) = L/2 - R_J(ε) - η(ε) using lem-phase-space-packing bounds on cluster radius R_J(ε). (5) Verify alive-set exclusion of near-side region via cloning pressure p_u(ε) > 0 from Section 8.3 of 03_cloning. This establishes the far-side cone constraint with quantitative geometric bounds.",

      "selector_justification": "Both strategies use contradiction via bisector geometry with similar core logic. Gemini provides cleaner proof structure with 6 well-defined steps, while Codex offers more explicit technical details on deriving R_I from contribution threshold and quantifying δ_geo. The hybrid approach takes Gemini's clear proof structure as the backbone and enriches it with Codex's quantitative constructions: (1) explicit R_I(ε) = sqrt(τ_H/k_min) - D_diam derivation from Step 2, (2) quantitative δ_geo(ε) = L/2 - R_J - η formula from Step 5, (3) alive-set dynamical exclusion via cloning pressure from Step 6. This synthesis provides both geometric clarity (Gemini) and rigorous quantitative bounds (Codex), making it optimal for the geometric core of Wasserstein-2 contraction proof."
