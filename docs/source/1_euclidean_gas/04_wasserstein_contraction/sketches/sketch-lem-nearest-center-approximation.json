  "statement": "For two separated swarms S_1, S_2 with barycenters x̄_1, x̄_2 satisfying separation L = ||x̄_1 - x̄_2|| > D_min(ε), and walker i in swarm k's alive set A_k, the geometric bisector constraint holds approximately: ⟨x_i - x̄_k, u⟩ ≥ -L/2 - δ_approx(ε), where u = (x̄_k - x̄_l)/L is the separation unit vector and δ_approx(ε) = O(R_spread) ≪ L/2.",

    "summary": "Project positions onto the separation axis and bound each alive walker's scalar deviation from its barycenter by the swarm spread radius. Using the stability condition, the alive set concentrates near the barycenter with radius R_spread(ε), while confining potential prevents large excursions. Since separation L exceeds the minimum viable gap and R_spread ≪ L, the scalar projection exceeds −L/2 up to an additive O(R_spread) error, yielding the approximate bisector constraint for all i ∈ A_k.",
    "keySteps": [
      "Step 1: Reduce to 1D along u by rewriting the bisector plane relative to x̄_k so the target inequality becomes s_i := ⟨x_i − x̄_k, u⟩ ≥ −L/2 − δ_approx(ε).",
      "Step 2: Bound projection by spread using Cauchy–Schwarz and alive-set concentration: |s_i| ≤ ||x_i − x̄_k|| ≤ R_spread(ε) for all i ∈ A_k.",
      "Step 3: Justify alive-set concentration (definition + stability): thm-stability-condition-final-corrected implies the fitness threshold selects walkers near x̄_k, giving a uniform R_spread(ε) for A_k.",
      "Step 4: Ensure scale separation: use L > D_min(ε) and R_spread(ε) ≪ L to choose δ_approx(ε) = c_u R_spread(ε), so −R_spread ≥ −L/2 − δ_approx holds.",
      "Step 5: Control barycenter sensitivity: show that small alive-set perturbations shift x̄_k by O(R_spread/|A_k|), absorbed into δ_approx.",
      "Step 6: Conclude the bisector constraint uniformly for all i ∈ A_k: s_i ≥ −L/2 − δ_approx(ε) with δ_approx = O(R_spread) ≪ L/2."
