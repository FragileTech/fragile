Conditional on cloning, the jitter distribution is Gaussian with fixed covariance; the resulting pushforward through the 1-Lipschitz squashing map $\\psi_v$ is Feller by Lemma {prf:ref}`lem-squashing-properties-generic`.

The status indicator is applied to $x^+$; Lemma {prf:ref}`lem-euclidean-boundary-holder` shows that the death probability varies continuously and that $\\mathbb P(x^+\\in\\partial\\mathcal X_{\\mathrm{valid}})=0$ under the $C^1$-boundary assumption, so the indicator preserves the Feller property.\n2278: ",
