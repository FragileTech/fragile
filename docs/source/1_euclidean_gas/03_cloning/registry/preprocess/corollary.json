From Total Positional Variance to Single-Swarm Positional Variance:**\nBy **{prf:ref}`lem-V_Varx-implies-variance`** (labeled $lem-V_{\\text{Var}}x-implies-variance$), if the total intra-swarm positional variance is large, $V_{\\text{Var},x} > R^2_{\\text{total\\_var},x}$, then at least one of the two swarms, say swarm `k`, must have a large internal positional variance:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_x(S_k) > \\frac{R^2_{\\text{total\\_var},x}}{2}\n$$\n\nWe define the threshold $R^2_{\\text{var}} := R^2_{\\text{total\\_var},x} / 2$.\n\n**2. From Positional Variance to Hypocoercive Variance:**\nSince the hypocoercive variance satisfies $\\mathrm{Var}_h(S_k) = \\mathrm{Var}_x(S_k) + \\lambda_v \\mathrm{Var}_v(S_k) \\ge \\mathrm{Var}_x(S_k)$ (as established in {prf:ref}`lem-var-x-implies-var-h`), the condition $\\mathrm{Var}_x(S_k) > R^2_{\\text{var}}$ is sufficient to guarantee that the total hypocoercive variance is also large:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_h(S_k) > R^2_{\\text{var}}\n$$\n\nThis satisfies the necessary premise for the lemmas governing both regimes of the $\\varepsilon$-dichotomy.\n\n**3. From Hypocoercive Variance to a High-Error Fraction:**\nWith the condition $\\mathrm{Var}_h(S_k) > R^2_{\\text{var}}$ met, we can now invoke the results of the $\\varepsilon$-dichotomy analysis:\n\n*   **If the swarm is in the large-$\\varepsilon$ regime** (where $\\varepsilon > D_swarm$): By {prf:ref}`def-unified-high-low-error-sets`, $H_k(\\epsilon) = O_k$ in this regime. **{prf:ref}`lem-outlier-fraction-lower-bound`** guarantees that the fraction of walkers in the global kinematic outlier set is bounded below by a positive, N-uniform constant: $|H_k(\\epsilon)|/k \\ge f_O > 0$.\n\n*   **If the swarm is in the small-$\\varepsilon$ regime** (where $\\varepsilon \\leq D_swarm$): By {prf:ref}`def-unified-high-low-error-sets`, $H_k(\\epsilon) = C_k(\\epsilon)$ (the clustering-based outlier set) in this regime. **{prf:ref}`lem-outlier-cluster-fraction-lower-bound`** guarantees that the fraction of walkers in the outlier clusters is bounded below by a positive, N-uniform constant: $|H_k(\\epsilon)|/k \\ge f_{H,\\text{cluster}}(\\epsilon) > 0$.\n\n**4. Define the Unified Lower Bound:**\nWe can define a single, unified lower bound $f_H(\\epsilon)$ that is valid for all regimes by taking the minimum of the bounds from the two cases:\n\n$$\nf_H(\\epsilon) := \\min(f_O, f_{H,\\text{cluster}}(\\epsilon))\n$$\n\nSince both $f_O$ and $f_{H,\\text{cluster}}(\\epsilon)$ are strictly positive, N-uniform constants, their minimum $f_H(\\epsilon)$ is also a strictly positive, N-uniform constant.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nWe have rigorously shown that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, if the total intra-swarm positional variance $V_{\\text{Var},x}$ is sufficiently large, then at least one swarm `k` is guaranteed to have a large hypocoercive variance, which in turn guarantees that the fraction of alive walkers in its unified high-error set $H_k(\\epsilon)$ is bounded below by the positive, N-uniform constant $f_H(\\epsilon)$. This establishes the direct causal link from the Lyapunov function's positional variance component to the guaranteed existence of a substantial high-error population.",

Recall the barrier function $\\varphi_{\\text{barrier}}(x)$ has the property:\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\text{barrier}}(x) \\to \\infty \\quad \\text{as} \\quad x \\to \\partial \\mathcal{X}_{\\text{valid}}\n$$\n\nDefine $\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{extinct}} := \\{x \\in \\mathcal{X}_{\\text{valid}} : d(x, \\partial \\mathcal{X}_{\\text{valid}}) < d_{\\text{extinct}}\\}$ as the boundary layer where walkers are marked as dead (typically $d_{\\text{extinct}} = \\delta$ is the cloning jitter radius).\n\n**Step 2: Barrier Value in the Extinction Zone.**\n\nSince $\\varphi_{\\text{barrier}}$ grows to infinity at the boundary and is continuous, there exists a minimum barrier value $\\varphi_{\\min} > 0$ in the extinction zone:\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\min} := \\inf_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}_{\\text{extinct}}} \\varphi_{\\text{barrier}}(x) > 0\n$$\n\nThis constant depends only on the geometry of $\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{valid}}$ and the barrier function construction.\n\n**Step 3: Walker Distribution from Bounded $W_b$.**\n\nIf the average barrier value satisfies:\n\n$$\nW_b = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\varphi_{\\text{barrier}}(x_i) \\leq \\frac{C_b}{\\kappa_b}\n$$\n\nthen the number of walkers in the extinction zone can be bounded. Let $N_{\\text{ext}}$ denote the number of walkers with $x_i \\in \\mathcal{X}_{\\text{extinct}}$. Then:\n\n$$\nN_{\\text{ext}} \\cdot \\varphi_{\\min} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^N \\varphi_{\\text{barrier}}(x_i) = N \\cdot W_b \\leq N \\cdot \\frac{C_b}{\\kappa_b}\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\nN_{\\text{ext}} \\leq N \\cdot \\frac{C_b}{\\kappa_b \\varphi_{\\min}}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Extinction Requires All Walkers to Cross.**\n\nFor total extinction in one step, all $N$ walkers must transition from their current positions into $\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{extinct}}$ simultaneously. The number of walkers that must make this crossing is at least:\n\n$$\nN_{\\text{cross}} := N - N_{\\text{ext}} \\geq N \\left(1 - \\frac{C_b}{\\kappa_b \\varphi_{\\min}}\\right) =: N \\cdot f_{\\text{safe}}\n$$\n\nwhere $f_{\\text{safe}} \\in (0, 1)$ is the fraction of walkers in the safe interior (bounded away from zero for sufficiently large $\\varphi_{\\min}$).\n\n**Step 5: Concentration Inequality for Boundary Crossing.**\n\nEach walker's position update includes bounded perturbation noise (from cloning jitter or kinetic diffusion) with characteristic scale $\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}$. For a walker at distance $d > d_{\\text{extinct}} + 2\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}$ from the boundary to cross into the extinction zone requires a deviation of at least $\\Delta d := d - d_{\\text{extinct}} > 2\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}$.\n\nBy Hoeffding's inequality (or Gaussian tail bounds if using Gaussian noise), the probability that any single safe walker crosses the boundary in one step is:\n\n$$\np_{\\text{cross}} \\leq \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\Delta d)^2}{2\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}^2}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Step 6: Union Bound for Total Extinction.**\n\nFor all $N \\cdot f_{\\text{safe}}$ safe walkers to simultaneously cross requires:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{extinction}) \\leq p_{\\text{cross}}^{N \\cdot f_{\\text{safe}}} = \\exp\\left(-N \\cdot f_{\\text{safe}} \\cdot \\frac{(\\Delta d)^2}{2\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}^2}\\right)\n$$\n\nDefining the rate constant:\n\n$$\nc_{\\text{extinct}} := f_{\\text{safe}} \\cdot \\frac{(\\Delta d)^2}{2\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}^2} > 0\n$$\n\nwe obtain:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{extinction}) \\leq \\exp(-N \\cdot c_{\\text{extinct}})\n$$\n\n**Step 7: Parameter Dependence.**\n\nThe rate constant $c_{\\text{extinct}}$ is bounded below by:\n\n$$\nc_{\\text{extinct}} \\geq \\left(1 - \\frac{C_b}{\\kappa_b \\varphi_{\\min}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d_{\\text{safe}}^2}{2\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $d_{\\text{safe}}$ is the typical distance from the safe interior to the extinction zone.
