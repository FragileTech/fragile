First, we invoke the proven geometric consequences for a high-variance swarm, which guarantee a separation in the *expected* distance measurements between the high-error and low-error subpopulations. Second, we prove that this separation between subpopulation means necessitates a non-zero variance in the set of all individual expected distances. Finally, we use the Law of Total Variance to show that this provides a direct lower bound for the total expected measurement variance.\n3380: \n3381: **1. Invoking Proven Guarantees on Expected Distances in the `d_alg` Metric.**\n3382: \n3383: The premise of the theorem is that $Var_x \\geq R^{2}_var$. From the results established in Chapter 6, this premise has two direct consequences:\n3384: \n3385: *   **Geometric Structure ({prf:ref}`cor-vvarx-to-high-error-fraction` & {prf:ref}`lem-geometric-separation-of-partition`):** The swarm's alive set `A_k` is guaranteed to contain a **unified high-error set** `H_k` and a **low-error set** `L_k = A_k \\ H_k`. The fractional sizes of these sets, `f_H = |H_k|/k` and `f_L = |L_k|/k`, are bounded below by positive, N-uniform constants. Furthermore, these sets possess distinct geometric separation properties in the **algorithmic phase-space metric (`d_alg`)**, as quantified by the constants $D_H(\\varepsilon)$ and $R_L(\\varepsilon)$.\n3386: \n3387: *   **Algorithmic Perception ({prf:ref}`lem-greedy-preserves-signal`):** The `Sequential Stochastic Greedy Pairing Operator`, when applied to this guaranteed geometric structure in `d_alg`, produces a statistical separation in the expected raw distance measurements for these two populations. Let $\\mu_d(H_k) = \\text{E}[d_i | i \\in H_k]$ be the mean expected distance for a high-error walker and $\\mu_d(L_k) = \\text{E}[d_j | j \\in L_k]$ be the mean for a low-error walker.\n3388: \n3389:     From , we have the bounds $\\mu_d(H_k) \\geq D_H(\\varepsilon)$ and $\\mu_d(L_k) \\leq R_L(\\varepsilon) + C_tail(\\varepsilon)$, where $C_tail(\\varepsilon)$ is a small, exponentially decaying error term accounting for boundary effects. As the separation $D_H(\\varepsilon) > R_L(\\varepsilon)$ is a required condition for a well-posed system (guaranteed by the Unified Condition from Section 6.5.4), we can choose parameters such that $D_H(\\varepsilon) - R_L(\\varepsilon)$ is large enough to dominate $C_tail(\\varepsilon)$.\n3390: \n3391:     We therefore define the guaranteed positive gap:\n3392: \n3393: \n3394: $$\n3395: \\kappa'_{\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon) := D_H(\\epsilon) - R_L(\\epsilon) - C_{\\text{tail}}(\\epsilon) > 0\n3396: $$\n3397: \n3398:     This ensures:\n3399: \n3400: \n3401: $$\n3402: \\mu_d(H_k) - \\mu_d(L_k) \\ge \\kappa'_{\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon) > 0\n3403: $$\n3404: \n3405: **2. From Subpopulation Mean Gap to Variance of Expectations.**\n3406: \n3407: Let `E_d` be the set of individual expected distances for all `k` alive walkers: `E_d = {E[d\u2081], E[d\u2082], ..., E[d_k]}`. We now prove that the gap between the subpopulation means, established above, forces the variance of this entire set, `Var(E_d)`, to be non-zero.\n3408: \n3409: The variance of a set partitioned into two subsets (`H_k`, `L_k`) is bounded below by the squared difference of their means, weighted by their population fractions. This follows from the Law of Total Variance, which states that for any partition:\n3410: \n3411: $$\n3412: \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{within}}(X) + \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{between}}(X)\n3413: $$\n3414: \n3415: where the within-group variance `Var_within(X)` is always non-negative. Therefore, the total variance is bounded below by the between-group variance:\n3416: \n3417: $$\n3418: \\operatorname{Var}(E_d) \\ge \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{between}}(E_d) = f_H f_L (\\mu_d(H_k) - \\mu_d(L_k))^2\n3419: $$\n3420: \n3421: Substituting the guaranteed bounds from Step 1, we get a uniform lower bound on the variance of the *expected* raw distances:\n3422: \n3423: $$\n3424: \\operatorname{Var}(E_d) \\ge f_H f_L (\\kappa'_{\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon))^2 > 0\n3425: $$\n3426: \n3427: **3. From Variance of Expectations to Expected Variance (The Key Inequality).**\n3428: \n3429: The final step is to prove the key inequality connecting the variance of the *expectations* to the expectation of the *variance*: $\\text{E}[\\text{Var}(d)] \\geq \\text{Var}(E_d)$.\n3430: \n3431: Let `d_i` denote the random distance measurement for walker `i`, and let $\\mu_i = \\text{E}[d_i]$ be its expectation. The empirical variance of the measurements is:\n3432: \n3433: $$\n3434: \\operatorname{Var}(d) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^k (d_i - \\bar{d})^2\n3435: $$\n3436: \n3437: where $bar{d} = (1/k) \\Sigma d_i$ is the sample mean.\n3438: \n3439: Taking expectations and using the fact that $\\text{E}[d_i] = \\mu_i$ and $\\text{E}[bar{d}] = bar{\\mu}$ where $bar{\\mu} = (1/k) \\Sigma \\mu_i$:\n3440: \n3441: $$\n3442: \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(d)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^k (d_i - \\bar{d})^2\\right]\n3443: $$\n3444: \n3445: We decompose each squared deviation using the standard technique. For each walker $i$, we write:\n3446: \n3447: $$\n3448: (d_i - \\bar{d})^2 = [(d_i - \\mu_i) + (\\mu_i - \\bar{d})]^2\n3449: $$\n3450: \n3451: Expanding and taking expectations term by term:\n3452: \n3453: $$\n3454: \\mathbb{E}[(d_i - \\bar{d})^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(d_i - \\mu_i)^2] + \\mathbb{E}[(\\mu_i - \\bar{d})^2] + 2\\mathbb{E}[(d_i - \\mu_i)(\\mu_i - \\bar{d})]\n3455: $$\n3456: \n3457: The **cross-term vanishes**: Since $\\mu_i$ is a constant (the expectation of $d_i$), we have:\n3458: \n3459: $$\n3460: \\mathbb{E}[(d_i - \\mu_i)(\\mu_i - \\bar{d})] = (\\mu_i - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{d}]) \\mathbb{E}[d_i - \\mu_i] = (\\mu_i - \\bar{\\mu}) \\cdot 0 = 0\n3461: $$\n3462: \n3463: The **first term** is simply the variance of $d_i$:\n3464: \n3465: $$\n3466: \\mathbb{E}[(d_i - \\mu_i)^2] = \\operatorname{Var}(d_i)\n3467: $$\n3468: \n3469: The **second term** requires care because $\\mu_i$ is constant but $\\bar{d}$ is random.

Since `f_H`, `f_L`, and $\\kappa'_gap(\\varepsilon)$ are all positive, N-uniform, $\\varepsilon$-dependent constants derived from the geometric analysis in Chapter 6, their product $\\kappa_meas(\\varepsilon)$ is also a positive, N-uniform, $\\varepsilon$-dependent constant.\n3504: \n3505: This completes the proof. We have rigorously shown that a large internal positional variance is sufficient to guarantee a non-zero expected variance in the raw distance measurements.",

First, we formalize the condition for intelligent targeting in terms of the expected log-fitness of the high-error and low-error populations. Second, we decompose this condition to isolate the trade-off between the diversity and reward signals. Third, we derive rigorous, uniform bounds for these signal gaps under worst-case adversarial conditions. Finally, we assemble these bounds to derive the necessary and sufficient inequality.\n3969: \n3970: **1. The Formal Condition for Intelligent Targeting**\n3971: \n3972: For the algorithm's targeting mechanism to be corrective, the high-error population `H_k` must, on average, be less fit than the low-error population `L_k = A_k \\setminus H_k`. Due to the multiplicative form of the fitness potential, $V_{\\text{fit}} = (d')^\\beta (r')^\\alpha$, the most robust way to analyze this condition is by comparing the expected logarithms of the fitness. The condition for intelligent targeting is therefore:\n3973: \n3974: $$\n3975: \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(V_{\\text{fit}}) \\mid i \\in H_k] < \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(V_{\\text{fit}}) \\mid i \\in L_k]\n3976: $$\n3977: \n3978: **2. Decomposing the Condition into a Signal Trade-off**\n3979: \n3980: Using the definition $ln(V_fit) = \\beta ln(d') + \\alpha ln(r')$ and the linearity of expectation, the condition from Step 1 becomes:\n3981: \n3982: $$\n3983: \\beta \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|H_k] + \\alpha \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|H_k] < \\beta \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|L_k] + \\alpha \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|L_k]\n3984: $$\n3985: \n3986: Rearranging the terms to separate the contribution from the diversity signal and the reward signal yields the core trade-off inequality that must be satisfied:\n3987: \n3988: $$\n3989: \\beta \\left( \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|H_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|L_k] \\right) > \\alpha \\left( \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|L_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|H_k] \\right) \\quad (*)\n3990: $$\n3991: \n3992: This inequality states that the fitness advantage from the reliable diversity signal (LHS, with \u03b2 > 0 from {prf:ref}`axiom-active-diversity`) must be strong enough to overcome the potential fitness advantage from a deceptive reward signal (RHS).\n3993: \n3994: **3. Deriving Uniform Bounds on the Signal Gaps**\n3995: \n3996: We now find uniform bounds for the two parenthesized terms in inequality `(*)`. This is the critical step where we correctly apply {prf:ref}`lem-variance-to-gap` to establish rigorous bounds. These bounds must hold for any swarm configuration, including the most adversarial ones.\n3997: \n3998: *   **LHS: The Minimum Guaranteed Diversity Signal.**\n3999: \n4000:     The term `E[ln(d')|H_k] - E[ln(d')|L_k]` represents the guaranteed advantage in the diversity signal for the high-error population. We establish this through the following causal chain:\n4001: \n4002:     1. **From Geometry to Raw Measurement Variance:** A high-error state guarantees a raw measurement variance $\\text{E}[\\text{Var}(d)] \\geq \\kappa_meas(\\varepsilon) > 0$ (from [](#thm-geometry-guarantees-variance)).\n4003: \n4004:     2. **From Raw Variance to Rescaled Variance:** This raw variance propagates through the pipeline, guaranteeing a variance in the rescaled values $\\text{Var}(d') \\geq \\kappa_var(d') > 0$. The constant $\\kappa_var(d')$ is defined in terms of $\\kappa_meas(\\varepsilon)$ and the pipeline parameters via the gap propagation lemmas from Section 7.3.\n4005: \n4006:     3. **Signal-to-Noise Condition:** The Signal-to-Noise Condition $\\kappa_var(d') > Var_max(d')$ is satisfied by the choice of the gain parameter $\\gamma$ (from {prf:ref}`prop-satisfiability-of-snr-gamma`).\n4007: \n4008:     4. **Applying [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation):** We now apply [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation) to the set of rescaled diversity values `d'`. Let:\n4009:         - `V = d'` (the total set of rescaled diversity values)\n4010:         - `H = H_k` and `L = L_k` (the partition)\n4011:         - The premise $\\text{Var}(V) \\geq \\kappa_var$ is met with $\\kappa_var = \\kappa_var(d')$\n4012:         - The premise $\\kappa_var > Var_max$ is met by the Signal-to-Noise Condition\n4013: \n4014:     5. **Result from [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation):** This yields a guaranteed lower bound on the separation between the subset means:\n4015: \n4016: \n4017: $$\n4018: |\\mathbb{E}[d'|H_k] - \\mathbb{E}[d'|L_k]| \\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f_H f_L}} \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{var}}(d') - \\operatorname{Var}_{\\max}(d')}\n4019: $$\n4020: \n4021:     6. **Define the Mean Gap Constant:** We define this entire N-uniform lower bound as:\n4022: \n4023: \n4024: $$\n4025: \\kappa_{\\text{mean},d'}(\\epsilon) := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f_H f_L}} \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{var}}(d') - \\operatorname{Var}_{\\max}(d')} > 0\n4026: $$\n4027: \n4028:     7. **From Mean Separation to Logarithmic Separation:** The smallest possible logarithmic gap corresponding to this minimal mean separation occurs when the values are compressed at the top of their allowed range, $[\\eta, g_A,max + \\eta]$. This provides a uniform lower bound on the reliable signal:\n4029: \n4030: \n4031: $$\n4032: \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|H_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|L_k] \\ge \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{mean},d'}(\\epsilon)}{g_{A,max}+\\eta}\\right)\n4033: $$\n4034: \n4035: *   **RHS: The Maximum Adversarial Reward Signal.**\n4036: \n4037:     Symmetrically, we apply the same logic to find an upper bound on the term `E[ln(r')|L_k] - E[ln(r')|H_k]`, which represents the maximum potential advantage from a deceptive reward signal. A potential adversarial raw gap $\\kappa_r'$ leads, through the application of [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation) to the reward channel, to a maximum possible rescaled mean gap of $\\kappa_{\\text{mean},r'}$. The largest possible logarithmic gap corresponding to this reward separation occurs when the values are compressed at the bottom of their range. This gives a uniform upper bound on the adversarial signal:\n4038: \n4039: \n4040: $$\n4041: \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|L_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|H_k] \\le \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{mean},r'}}{\\eta}\\right)\n4042: $$\n4043: \n4044: **4. Assembling the Final Stability Condition**\n4045: \n4046: For the intelligent targeting inequality `(*)` to hold robustly for *any* high-variance swarm, the guaranteed *minimum* of the LHS must be strictly greater than the allowed *maximum* of the RHS. The assembly of the final condition is now rigorous because it compares provably non-vanishing bounds on the *means of the populations*, not on unrepresentative individual values. Substituting the bounds derived in Stage 3 gives the necessary and sufficient condition.",

First, we formalize the condition for intelligent targeting in terms of the expected log-fitness of the high-error and low-error populations. Second, we decompose this condition to isolate the trade-off between the diversity and reward signals. Third, we derive rigorous, uniform bounds for these signal gaps under worst-case adversarial conditions. Finally, we assemble these bounds to derive the necessary and sufficient inequality.\n3969: \n3970: **1. The Formal Condition for Intelligent Targeting**\n3971: \n3972: For the algorithm's targeting mechanism to be corrective, the high-error population `H_k` must, on average, be less fit than the low-error population `L_k = A_k \\setminus H_k`. Due to the multiplicative form of the fitness potential, $V_{\\text{fit}} = (d')^\\beta (r')^\\alpha$, the most robust way to analyze this condition is by comparing the expected logarithms of the fitness. The condition for intelligent targeting is therefore:\n3973: \n3974: $$\n3975: \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(V_{\\text{fit}}) \\mid i \\in H_k] < \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(V_{\\text{fit}}) \\mid i \\in L_k]\n3976: $$\n3977: \n3978: **2. Decomposing the Condition into a Signal Trade-off**\n3979: \n3980: Using the definition $ln(V_fit) = \\beta ln(d') + \\alpha ln(r')$ and the linearity of expectation, the condition from Step 1 becomes:\n3981: \n3982: $$\n3983: \\beta \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|H_k] + \\alpha \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|H_k] < \\beta \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|L_k] + \\alpha \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|L_k]\n3984: $$\n3985: \n3986: Rearranging the terms to separate the contribution from the diversity signal and the reward signal yields the core trade-off inequality that must be satisfied:\n3987: \n3988: $$\n3989: \\beta \\left( \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|H_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|L_k] \\right) > \\alpha \\left( \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|L_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|H_k] \\right) \\quad (*)\n3990: $$\n3991: \n3992: This inequality states that the fitness advantage from the reliable diversity signal (LHS, with \u03b2 > 0 from {prf:ref}`axiom-active-diversity`) must be strong enough to overcome the potential fitness advantage from a deceptive reward signal (RHS).\n3993: \n3994: **3. Deriving Uniform Bounds on the Signal Gaps**\n3995: \n3996: We now find uniform bounds for the two parenthesized terms in inequality `(*)`. This is the critical step where we correctly apply {prf:ref}`lem-variance-to-gap` to establish rigorous bounds. These bounds must hold for any swarm configuration, including the most adversarial ones.\n3997: \n3998: *   **LHS: The Minimum Guaranteed Diversity Signal.**\n3999: \n4000:     The term `E[ln(d')|H_k] - E[ln(d')|L_k]` represents the guaranteed advantage in the diversity signal for the high-error population. We establish this through the following causal chain:\n4001: \n4002:     1. **From Geometry to Raw Measurement Variance:** A high-error state guarantees a raw measurement variance $\\text{E}[\\text{Var}(d)] \\geq \\kappa_meas(\\varepsilon) > 0$ (from [](#thm-geometry-guarantees-variance)).\n4003: \n4004:     2. **From Raw Variance to Rescaled Variance:** This raw variance propagates through the pipeline, guaranteeing a variance in the rescaled values $\\text{Var}(d') \\geq \\kappa_var(d') > 0$. The constant $\\kappa_var(d')$ is defined in terms of $\\kappa_meas(\\varepsilon)$ and the pipeline parameters via the gap propagation lemmas from Section 7.3.\n4005: \n4006:     3. **Signal-to-Noise Condition:** The Signal-to-Noise Condition $\\kappa_var(d') > Var_max(d')$ is satisfied by the choice of the gain parameter $\\gamma$ (from {prf:ref}`prop-satisfiability-of-snr-gamma`).\n4007: \n4008:     4. **Applying [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation):** We now apply [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation) to the set of rescaled diversity values `d'`. Let:\n4009:         - `V = d'` (the total set of rescaled diversity values)\n4010:         - `H = H_k` and `L = L_k` (the partition)\n4011:         - The premise $\\text{Var}(V) \\geq \\kappa_var$ is met with $\\kappa_var = \\kappa_var(d')$\n4012:         - The premise $\\kappa_var > Var_max$ is met by the Signal-to-Noise Condition\n4013: \n4014:     5. **Result from [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation):** This yields a guaranteed lower bound on the separation between the subset means:\n4015: \n4016: \n4017: $$\n4018: |\\mathbb{E}[d'|H_k] - \\mathbb{E}[d'|L_k]| \\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f_H f_L}} \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{var}}(d') - \\operatorname{Var}_{\\max}(d')}\n4019: $$\n4020: \n4021:     6. **Define the Mean Gap Constant:** We define this entire N-uniform lower bound as:\n4022: \n4023: \n4024: $$\n4025: \\kappa_{\\text{mean},d'}(\\epsilon) := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f_H f_L}} \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{var}}(d') - \\operatorname{Var}_{\\max}(d')} > 0\n4026: $$\n4027: \n4028:     7. **From Mean Separation to Logarithmic Separation:** The smallest possible logarithmic gap corresponding to this minimal mean separation occurs when the values are compressed at the top of their allowed range, $[\\eta, g_A,max + \\eta]$. This provides a uniform lower bound on the reliable signal:\n4029: \n4030: \n4031: $$\n4032: \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|H_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(d')|L_k] \\ge \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{mean},d'}(\\epsilon)}{g_{A,max}+\\eta}\\right)\n4033: $$\n4034: \n4035: *   **RHS: The Maximum Adversarial Reward Signal.**\n4036: \n4037:     Symmetrically, we apply the same logic to find an upper bound on the term `E[ln(r')|L_k] - E[ln(r')|H_k]`, which represents the maximum potential advantage from a deceptive reward signal. A potential adversarial raw gap $\\kappa_r'$ leads, through the application of [](#lem-variance-to-mean-separation) to the reward channel, to a maximum possible rescaled mean gap of $\\kappa_{\\text{mean},r'}$. The largest possible logarithmic gap corresponding to this reward separation occurs when the values are compressed at the bottom of their range. This gives a uniform upper bound on the adversarial signal:\n4038: \n4039: \n4040: $$\n4041: \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|L_k] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(r')|H_k] \\le \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{mean},r'}}{\\eta}\\right)\n4042: $$\n4043: \n4044: **4. Assembling the Final Stability Condition**\n4045: \n4046: For the intelligent targeting inequality `(*)` to hold robustly for *any* high-variance swarm, the guaranteed *minimum* of the LHS must be strictly greater than the allowed *maximum* of the RHS. The assembly of the final condition is now rigorous because it compares provably non-vanishing bounds on the *means of the populations*, not on unrepresentative individual values. Substituting the bounds derived in Stage 3 gives the necessary and sufficient condition.\n4047: "

The sum of positive deviations, $\\sum_{i \\in F_k} (V_{k,i} - \\mu_{V,k})$, must be at least this large. By the balance of deviations, the sum of negative deviations must also satisfy this bound. We can then bound this sum by its size, $|U_k|$, multiplied by the maximum possible value for any single term, which is bounded by the total potential range $V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}$:\n4643: \n4644: \n4645: $$\n4646: |U_k| \\cdot (V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}) \\ge \\sum_{j \\in U_k} (\\mu_{V,k} - V_{k,j}) \\ge \\frac{\\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)}{2}\n4647: $$\n4648: \n4649:         This directly yields the desired lower bound on $|U_k|$.\n4650: \n4651:     *   **Case B:** If $(\\mu_{V,k} - V_{\\min,k}) \\ge \\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)/2$. By a symmetric argument, the sum of negative deviations is at least this large. This implies the sum of positive deviations is also this large. Bounding the sum of positive deviations:\n4652: \n4653: \n4654: $$\n4655: |F_k| \\cdot (V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}) \\ge \\sum_{i \\in F_k} (V_{i,k} - \\mu_{V,k}) \\ge \\frac{\\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)}{2}\n4656: $$\n4657: \n4658:         This gives a lower bound on the size of the *fit* set: $|F_k|/k \\ge \\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}} / (2(V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}))$. Since $|U_k| + |F_k| = k$, this implies an *upper bound* on the size of the unfit set. However, a simpler argument is to note that if the unfit set were vanishingly small, the mean would be pulled towards $V_{\\max,k}$, making $(\\mu_{V,k} - V_{\\min,k})$ large and contradicting the mean's location. The bound from Case A thus represents the worst-case scenario for the size of the unfit set, providing a valid global lower bound.\n4659: \n4660: 4.  **Conclusion:** Rearranging the inequality from Step 3 and dividing by `k` gives the final result for the fraction of unfit walkers. The lower bound, $f_U(\\epsilon)$, is a strictly positive, N-uniform, and $\\varepsilon$-dependent constant, as it is constructed from other N-uniform constants.",

Let $F_k$ be the \"fit\" set (the complement of $U_k$). Partitioning the sum over these two sets shows that the total positive deviation equals the magnitude of the total negative deviation:\n4628: \n4629: \n4630: $$\n4631: \\sum_{i \\in F_k} (V_{k,i} - \\mu_{V,k}) = \\sum_{j \\in U_k} (\\mu_{V,k} - V_{k,j})\n4632: $$\n4633: \n4634: 2.  **Bounding the Total Deviation:** The total range of fitness values, $V_{\\max,k} - V_{\\min,k}$, can be partitioned at the mean: $V_{\\max,k} - V_{\\min,k} = (V_{\\max,k} - \\mu_{V,k}) + (\\mu_{V,k} - V_{\\min,k})$. Since both terms on the right are non-negative, at least one of them must be greater than or equal to half of the total range. Using the premise, we have:\n4635: \n4636: \n4637: $$\n4638: \\max\\left( (V_{\\max,k} - \\mu_{V,k}), (\\mu_{V,k} - V_{\\min,k}) \\right) \\ge \\frac{\\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)}{2}\n4639: $$\n4640: \n4641: 3.  **Case Analysis:**\n4642:     *   **Case A:** If $(V_{\\max,k} - \\mu_{V,k}) \\ge \\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)/2$. The sum of positive deviations, $\\sum_{i \\in F_k} (V_{k,i} - \\mu_{V,k})$, must be at least this large. By the balance of deviations, the sum of negative deviations must also satisfy this bound. We can then bound this sum by its size, $|U_k|$, multiplied by the maximum possible value for any single term, which is bounded by the total potential range $V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}$:\n4643: \n4644: \n4645: $$\n4646: |U_k| \\cdot (V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}) \\ge \\sum_{j \\in U_k} (\\mu_{V,k} - V_{k,j}) \\ge \\frac{\\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)}{2}\n4647: $$\n4648: \n4649:         This directly yields the desired lower bound on $|U_k|$.\n4650: \n4651:     *   **Case B:** If $(\\mu_{V,k} - V_{\\min,k}) \\ge \\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)/2$. By a symmetric argument, the sum of negative deviations is at least this large. This implies the sum of positive deviations is also this large. Bounding the sum of positive deviations:\n4652: \n4653: \n4654: $$\n4655: |F_k| \\cdot (V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}) \\ge \\sum_{i \\in F_k} (V_{i,k} - \\mu_{V,k}) \\ge \\frac{\\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}}(\\epsilon)}{2}\n4656: $$\n4657: \n4658:         This gives a lower bound on the size of the *fit* set: $|F_k|/k \\ge \\kappa_{V,\\text{gap}} / (2(V_{\\text{pot,max}} - V_{\\text{pot,min}}))$. Since $|U_k| + |F_k| = k$, this implies an *upper bound* on the size of the unfit set. However, a simpler argument is to note that if the unfit set were vanishingly small, the mean would be pulled towards $V_{\\max,k}$, making $(\\mu_{V,k} - V_{\\min,k})$ large and contradicting the mean's location. The bound from Case A thus represents the worst-case scenario for the size of the unfit set, providing a valid global lower bound.\n4659: \n4660: 4.  **Conclusion:** Rearranging the inequality from Step 3 and dividing by `k` gives the final result for the fraction of unfit walkers. The lower bound, $f_U(\\epsilon)$, is a strictly positive, N-uniform, and $\\varepsilon$-dependent constant, as it is constructed from other N-uniform constants.\n4661: "
