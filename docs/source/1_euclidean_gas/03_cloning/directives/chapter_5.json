The velocity regularization term in {prf:ref}`axiom-velocity-regularization` ensures walkers with $\\|v\\|^2 > V_{\\text{thresh}}^2$ have extremely low fitness and are preferentially cloned, where $V_{\\text{thresh}}$ is determined by the balance between the positional reward scale and the regularization coefficient $c_{v\\_reg}$.\n2142: \n2143: 3. These mechanisms ensure that in any viable swarm state (where extinction probability is negligible), all walker velocities satisfy $\\|v_i\\| \\leq V_{\\max}$ for a finite constant:\n2144: \n2145: $$\n2146: V_{\\max}^2 := \\max\\left\\{ \\frac{2F_{\\max}}{\\gamma}, V_{\\text{thresh}}^2 \\right\\}\n2147: $$\n2148: \n2149: This bound is **state-independent**, depending only on the domain geometry ($F_{\\max}$), algorithmic parameters ($\\gamma$, $c_{v\\_reg}$), and the reward scale.\n2150: \n2151: **Part 2: Bounding the Per-Walker Variance Change**\n2152: \n2153: Consider a single walker $i$ that is cloned at step $t$. Let $v_i^{\\text{old}}$ be its velocity before cloning and $v_i^{\\text{new}}$ be its velocity after the inelastic collision reset. Let $\\mu_v^{\\text{old}}$ and $\\mu_v^{\\text{new}}$ be the velocity barycentres before and after cloning.\n2154: \n2155: The contribution of walker $i$ to the velocity variance changes as:\n2156: \n2157: $$\n2158: \\Delta_i := \\|v_i^{\\text{new}} - \\mu_v^{\\text{new}}\\|^2 - \\|v_i^{\\text{old}} - \\mu_v^{\\text{old}}\\|^2\n2159: $$\n2160: \n2161: We bound this change using the triangle inequality and the velocity domain bounds. First, note that:\n2162: \n2163: $$\n2164: \\|v_i^{\\text{new}} - \\mu_v^{\\text{new}}\\|^2 \\leq 2\\|v_i^{\\text{new}}\\|^2 + 2\\|\\mu_v^{\\text{new}}\\|^2 \\leq 2V_{\\max}^2 + 2V_{\\max}^2 = 4V_{\\max}^2\n2165: $$\n2166: \n2167: Similarly, $\\|v_i^{\\text{old}} - \\mu_v^{\\text{old}}\\|^2 \\geq 0$. Therefore:\n2168: \n2169: $$\n2170: \\Delta_i \\leq 4V_{\\max}^2\n2171: $$\n2172: \n2173: However, this is a worst-case bound. We can obtain a tighter bound by analyzing the inelastic collision mechanism directly.\n2174: \n2175: **Step 2a: The Inelastic Collision Model**\n2176: \n2177: When walker $i$ is cloned, it participates in an inelastic collision with $M$ companion walkers. Let $v_i^{\\text{old}}$ and $\\{v_j^{\\text{comp}}\\}_{j=1}^M$ be the velocities of the participants. The center-of-mass velocity is:\n2178: \n2179: $$\n2180: V_{\\text{COM}} = \\frac{1}{M+1}\\left(v_i^{\\text{old}} + \\sum_{j=1}^M v_j^{\\text{comp}}\\right)\n2181: $$\n2182: \n2183: The new velocity is computed via:\n2184: \n2185: $$\n2186: v_i^{\\text{new}} = V_{\\text{COM}} + \\alpha_{\\text{restitution}} \\cdot R(u_i)\n2187: $$\n2188: \n2189: where $u_i = v_i^{\\text{old}} - V_{\\text{COM}}$ is the old relative velocity and $R$ is a random rotation.

The change in $V_{Var,v}$ can be decomposed into three contributions:\n2222: \n2223: 1. **Direct variance change from velocity resets** (cloned walkers)\n2224: 2. **Barycentre shift effect** (changes $\\mu_v$, affecting all walkers)\n2225: 3. **Status changes** (deaths and revivals)\n2226: \n2227: We bound each contribution separately.\n2228: \n2229: **Contribution 1 (Direct Reset):** For each cloned walker $i \\in \\mathcal{C}$, the velocity changes from $v_i^{\\text{old}}$ to $v_i^{\\text{new}}$.
