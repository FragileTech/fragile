For a test function $\\Phi(S) = \\phi(z_1)$ that depends only on the state of the first particle, this implies:\n2032:     $$\n2033:     \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}^{QSD}}[\\mathcal{L}_{N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = 0\n2034:     $$\n2035:     Decomposing the generator, we have $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] + \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clone}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = 0$ for all $k$.\n2036: \n2037: 2.  **Limit of the Kinetic Term:**\n2038:     The kinetic generator $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}, N_k}$ acts only on the state of particle 1. The expectation is therefore an integral against the first marginal: $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}} \\phi(z_1)] = \\int_{\\Omega} (L\\phi)(z) d\\mu_{N_k}(z)$.

The cloning rate for walker 1 depends on its fitness relative to companions drawn from the *empirical measure* of the other $N_k-1$ particles. As $k \\to \\infty$, the law of large numbers for exchangeable particles (a key consequence of the Hewitt-Savage theorem) implies that this empirical measure converges weakly to the law of a single particle, which is our limit measure $\\mu_\\infty$.\n2045: \n2046:     The cloning operator for walker 1, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clone}, N_k}\\phi(z_1)$, is a function of the state of walker 1 and the empirical measure of its companions, $\\mu_{N_k-1}^{\\text{comp}}$.

By the bounded convergence theorem (justified by the uniform boundedness of the generator's action on $\\phi$), the expectation also converges:\n2051:     $$\n2052:     \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clone}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = \\int_{\\Omega} S[\\rho_0]\\phi(z) dz\n2053:     $$\n2054:     $$\n2055:     \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{boundary}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = \\int_{\\Omega} (-c(z)\\rho_0 + B[\\rho_0, m_{d,\\infty}])\\phi(z) dz\n2056:     $$\n2057: \n2058: 4.  **Conclusion:**\n2059:     Taking the limit of the entire N-particle stationarity condition, we have shown that each term converges to its mean-field counterpart.

For a test function $\\Phi(S) = \\phi(z_1)$ that depends only on the state of the first particle, this implies:\n2032:     $$\n2033:     \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}^{QSD}}[\\mathcal{L}_{N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = 0\n2034:     $$\n2035:     Decomposing the generator, we have $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] + \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clone}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = 0$ for all $k$.\n2036: \n2037: 2.  **Limit of the Kinetic Term:**\n2038:     The kinetic generator $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}, N_k}$ acts only on the state of particle 1. The expectation is therefore an integral against the first marginal: $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}} \\phi(z_1)] = \\int_{\\Omega} (L\\phi)(z) d\\mu_{N_k}(z)$. Since $\\mu_{N_k} \\rightharpoonup \\mu_\\infty$ and $L\\phi$ is a bounded, continuous function (as $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty$), the integral converges:\n2039:     $$\n2040:     \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\int_{\\Omega} (L\\phi)(z) d\\mu_{N_k}(z) = \\int_{\\Omega} (L\\phi)(z) d\\mu_{\\infty}(z) = \\int_{\\Omega} (L^\\dagger\\rho_0)(z)\\phi(z) \\, dz\n2041:     $$\n2042: \n2043: 3.  **Limit of the Cloning Term (Propagation of Chaos):**\n2044:     This is the critical step. The cloning rate for walker 1 depends on its fitness relative to companions drawn from the *empirical measure* of the other $N_k-1$ particles. As $k \\to \\infty$, the law of large numbers for exchangeable particles (a key consequence of the Hewitt-Savage theorem) implies that this empirical measure converges weakly to the law of a single particle, which is our limit measure $\\mu_\\infty$.\n2045: \n2046:     The cloning operator for walker 1, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clone}, N_k}\\phi(z_1)$, is a function of the state of walker 1 and the empirical measure of its companions, $\\mu_{N_k-1}^{\\text{comp}}$. We have already proven:\n2047:     *   The empirical companion measure converges: $\\mu_{N_k-1}^{\\text{comp}} \\rightharpoonup \\mu_\\infty$ almost surely.\n2048:     *   The functionals for moments and fitness potentials are continuous with respect to weak convergence.\n2049: \n2050:     Therefore, the N-particle cloning and boundary operators, which are continuous functions of these empirical measures, converge point-wise to the mean-field operators. By the bounded convergence theorem (justified by the uniform boundedness of the generator's action on $\\phi$), the expectation also converges:\n2051:     $$\n2052:     \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clone}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = \\int_{\\Omega} S[\\rho_0]\\phi(z) dz\n2053:     $$\n2054:     $$\n2055:     \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{N_k}}[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{boundary}, N_k} \\phi(z_1)] = \\int_{\\Omega} (-c(z)\\rho_0 + B[\\rho_0, m_{d,\\infty}])\\phi(z) dz\n2056:     $$\n2057: \n2058: 4.  **Conclusion:**\n2059:     Taking the limit of the entire N-particle stationarity condition, we have shown that each term converges to its mean-field counterpart. The limit measure $\\mu_\\infty$ must therefore satisfy:\n2060:     $$\n2061:     \\int_\\Omega \\left(L^\\dagger \\rho_0(z) - c(z)\\rho_0(z) + S[\\rho_0](z) + B[\\rho_0, m_{d,\\infty}](z)\\right) \\phi(z) \\, dz = 0\n2062:     $$\n2063:     This holds for any $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega)$, which is the definition of a weak solution.\n2064: "

The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem then guarantees the uniqueness of the solution.\n2082: \n2083: 1.  **The Fixed-Point Formulation:**\n2084:     The stationary equation is $0 = L^\\dagger \\rho + S[\\rho] + B[\\rho]$. We rewrite this by isolating the linear, diffusive part. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{lin}} = L^\\dagger - C \\cdot I$ for a sufficiently large constant $C > 0$ such that $-\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{lin}}$ is an invertible, coercive operator. The equation becomes $\\rho = (-\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{lin}})^{-1}(S[\\rho] + B[\\rho] + C\\rho)$.

We consider the operator $\\mathcal{T}$ acting on the closed subset of probability densities, $\\mathcal{P} \\subset H^1_w(\\Omega)$.\n2092: \n2093: 3.  **Lipschitz Continuity of the Non-Linear Operators:**\n2094:     The core of the proof is to show that the non-linear operators, $S[\\rho]$ and $B[\\rho]$, are Lipschitz continuous on $\\mathcal{P}$. That is, there exist constants $L_S$ and $L_B$ such that:\n2095:     $$\n2096:     \\|S[\\rho_1] - S[\\rho_2]\\|_{H^1_w} \\le L_S \\|\\rho_1 - \\rho_2\\|_{H^1_w}\n2097:     $$\n2098:     and similarly for $B[\\rho]$.

This operator is not elliptic but **hypoelliptic**. A key result from the theory of hypoelliptic operators (leveraging H\u00f6rmander's theorem) is that this inverse operator is a bounded map from $L^2_w(\\Omega)$ to $H^1_w(\\Omega)$.
