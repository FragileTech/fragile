      "raw_directive": "125: The analysis in `06_convergence.md` established, via a Foster-Lyapunov drift condition, that for any fixed, finite number of walkers $N \\ge 2$, the Euclidean Gas Markov process converges exponentially fast to a unique statistical equilibrium, conditioned on survival. This foundational result provides us with a countably infinite sequence of well-defined N-particle stationary measures. Our strategy is to leverage this sequence to construct the stationary state of the continuous mean-field model. We begin by formally defining these measures.\n126: \n127: :::{prf:definition} Sequence of N-Particle QSDs and their Marginals\n128: :label: def-sequence-of-qsds\n129: \n130: 1.  **The N-Particle Quasi-Stationary Distribution.** For each integer $N \\ge 2$, let $\\nu_N^{QSD} \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Sigma_N)$ be the **unique Quasi-Stationary Distribution** for the N-particle Euclidean Gas, whose existence and uniqueness were established in `06_convergence.md`.
