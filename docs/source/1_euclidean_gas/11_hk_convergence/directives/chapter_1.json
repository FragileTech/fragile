      "raw_directive": "34: The Hellinger-Kantorovich metric is a development in optimal transport theory (Liero, Mielke, Savar\u00e9, *Invent. Math.* 2018) that unifies two classical distances: the **Wasserstein metric** (spatial displacement) and the **Hellinger distance** (mass and shape changes).\n35: \n36: :::{prf:definition} Additive Hellinger-Kantorovich Metric for the Fragile Gas\n37: :label: def-hk-metric-intro\n38: \n39: For sub-probability measures $\\mu_1, \\mu_2$ on $(\\mathcal{X}, d)$, we define the **additive Hellinger-Kantorovich distance**:\n40: \n41: $$\n42: d_{HK}^2(\\mu_1, \\mu_2) := d_H^2(\\mu_1, \\mu_2) + W_2^2(\\tilde{\\mu}_1, \\tilde{\\mu}_2)\n43: \n44: $$\n45: \n46: where:\n47: - $d_H^2(\\mu_1, \\mu_2) = \\int (\\sqrt{f_1} - \\sqrt{f_2})^2 d\\lambda$ is the Hellinger distance ($f_i = d\\mu_i/d\\lambda$)\n48: - $W_2^2(\\tilde{\\mu}_1, \\tilde{\\mu}_2)$ is the Wasserstein-2 distance between normalizations $\\tilde{\\mu}_i = \\mu_i/\\|\\mu_i\\|$\n49: \n50: **Relationship to the Canonical HK Metric**: The canonical Hellinger-Kantorovich metric (Liero et al. 2018) uses a cone-geometry construction that couples mass variation and transport through optimal couplings on the extended space.
