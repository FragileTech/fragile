# Computational Metabolism: The Landauer Bound and Deliberation Dynamics

*Abstract.* We establish a thermodynamic foundation for internal inference by coupling computation time $s$ to an energetic cost functional. We model the agent as an open system where belief updates are dissipative processes. By applying Landauer's Principle {cite}`landauer1961irreversibility` to the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) flow, we prove that the optimal allocation of computation time $S^*$ emerges from the stationarity of a **Dual-Horizon Action**. We derive a rigorous phase transition between reflexive (fast) and deliberative (slow) regimes {cite}`kahneman2011thinking`, governed by the ratio of the task-gradient norm to the metabolic dissipation rate.

Most agents spend the same amount of FLOPs on a trivial decision as a critical one. We use the **Landauer Bound** to assign a thermodynamic cost to information updates. The agent stops "deliberating" ($S^*$) exactly when the marginal gain in Value is outweighed by the metabolic cost of more compute. This derives "System 1 vs System 2" behavior from first principles.

Now here is a question that I think is absolutely fundamental, and yet most people building intelligent systems never even ask it: **How long should you think before you act?**

You see, in most of our theories about intelligent agents, we treat thinking as if it were free. The agent can compute for as long as it wants, refine its beliefs to arbitrary precision, and only then decide what to do. But that is not how the real world works. Thinking costs something. Every bit of computation burns energy. Every moment spent deliberating is a moment you are not acting, and the world keeps changing around you.

So there must be some sweet spot, some optimal duration of thought, where the benefit of thinking more is exactly balanced by the cost of that additional thinking. And what we are going to show in this section is that this optimal stopping time is not just a practical consideration---it is a fundamental law, derivable from thermodynamics.

The key insight comes from Landauer's Principle, which tells us something remarkable: there is a minimum energy cost to process information. When you update your beliefs---when you become more certain about something---you must pay an energy price. There is no free lunch in the thermodynamics of computation.

And here is the beautiful thing: once we accept that thinking has a cost, the question of "when to stop thinking" becomes a variational problem. We can write down an action, take its derivative, set it to zero, and out pops the optimal deliberation time. System 1 (fast, reflexive) and System 2 (slow, deliberative) are not psychological categories---they are phases of a single physical system, separated by a phase transition.

## The Energetics of Information Updates

We begin by mapping the abstract WFR belief dynamics ({ref}`Section 20 <sec-wasserstein-fisher-rao-geometry-unified-transport-on-hybrid-state-spaces>`) {cite}`chizat2018unbalanced,liero2018optimal` to physical dissipation via Landauer's Principle.

:::{div} feynman-prose
Before we dive into the formalism, let me explain what we are doing here in physical terms.

Imagine the agent's belief as a cloud of probability distributed over its latent space. When the agent thinks---when it processes information and updates its beliefs---this cloud moves and reshapes. Some probability mass flows from one region to another (that is the transport part). Some mass might appear or disappear (that is the reaction part, for when hypotheses are created or abandoned).

Now, all of this motion costs energy. The question is: how much?

The metabolic flux we are about to define is the instantaneous rate of energy expenditure. Think of it as the agent's "caloric burn rate for thinking." It has two components: one for moving probability around (like dragging a weight across a floor), and one for creating or destroying probability mass (like the cost of building or demolishing a house). Both cost energy, and the WFR geometry tells us exactly how to measure those costs.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Metabolic Flux
:label: def-metabolic-flux

Let $\rho(s, z)$ be the belief density evolving in computation time $s$ according to the WFR continuity equation (Definition {prf:ref}`def-the-wfr-action`):

$$
\partial_s \rho + \nabla \cdot (\rho v) = \rho r.

$$
We define the **Metabolic Flux** $\dot{\mathcal{M}}: \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ as:

$$
\dot{\mathcal{M}}(s) := \sigma_{\text{met}} \int_{\mathcal{Z}} \left( \|v_s(z)\|_G^2 + \lambda^2 |r_s(z)|^2 \right) \rho(s, z) \, d\mu_G,

$$
where:
- $\sigma_{\text{met}} > 0$ is the **metabolic resistance coefficient** (units: nat$\cdot$step)
- $v_s(z)$ is the velocity field at computation time $s$
- $r_s(z)$ is the reaction rate (mass creation/destruction)
- $\lambda$ is the WFR length-scale (Definition {prf:ref}`def-the-wfr-action`)
- $d\mu_G = \sqrt{\det G} \, dz$ is the Riemannian volume form

*Physical interpretation:* The metabolic flux measures the instantaneous rate of energy dissipation required to update the belief distribution. Transport ($\|v\|_G^2$) represents the cost of moving probability mass; reaction ($|r|^2$) represents the cost of creating or destroying mass. The WFR action is the kinetic energy of the belief flow.

:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me unpack what this definition is really saying.

The metabolic flux $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$ is an integral over all of latent space, weighted by the belief density $\rho$. This weighting is crucial: we only pay energy costs where we actually have probability mass. If some region of belief space is empty, we do not pay to move things there.

The two terms inside the integral are the transport cost and the reaction cost:

1. **Transport cost** $\|v\|_G^2$: This is the squared velocity, measured in the Riemannian metric $G$. The metric matters! Moving in directions the geometry says are "expensive" costs more than moving in "cheap" directions. This is like pushing a cart---it is easier to push it on a smooth floor than uphill through mud.

2. **Reaction cost** $\lambda^2 |r|^2$: This is the squared rate of mass creation or destruction, scaled by $\lambda^2$. Remember, $\lambda$ is the length scale where transport and reaction costs balance. If $\lambda$ is large, reactions are expensive relative to transport; if small, reactions are cheap.

The coefficient $\sigma_{\text{met}}$ is the "metabolic resistance"---it converts the abstract WFR kinetic energy into physical energy units. Think of it as the agent's efficiency: a high $\sigma_{\text{met}}$ means the agent burns a lot of energy for each unit of belief update.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Generalized Landauer Bound
:label: thm-generalized-landauer-bound

The metabolic flux $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$ provides a physical lower bound on the rate of entropy reduction within the agent. Specifically:

$$
\dot{\mathcal{M}}(s) \ge T_c \left| \frac{d}{ds} H(\rho_s) \right|,

$$
where $H(\rho_s) = -\int_{\mathcal{Z}} \rho \ln \rho \, d\mu_G$ is the Shannon entropy and $T_c$ is the cognitive temperature ({prf:ref}`def-cognitive-temperature`, {ref}`Section 22.4 <sec-the-geodesic-baoab-integrator>`).

*Proof sketch.* The time derivative of the Shannon entropy is:

$$
\frac{d}{ds} H(\rho_s) = -\int_{\mathcal{Z}} (1 + \ln \rho) \partial_s \rho \, d\mu_G.

$$
Substituting the WFR continuity equation and integrating by parts (assuming vanishing flux at $\partial\mathcal{Z}$):

$$
\frac{d}{ds} H = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} \rho \langle \nabla \ln \rho, v \rangle_G \, d\mu_G - \int_{\mathcal{Z}} r \ln \rho \cdot \rho \, d\mu_G.

$$
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the tangent bundle $(T\mathcal{Z}, G)$:

$$
\left| \int_{\mathcal{Z}} \rho \langle \nabla \ln \rho, v \rangle_G \, d\mu_G \right| \le \left( \int_{\mathcal{Z}} \rho \|\nabla \ln \rho\|_G^2 \, d\mu_G \right)^{1/2} \left( \int_{\mathcal{Z}} \rho \|v\|_G^2 \, d\mu_G \right)^{1/2}.

$$
The first factor is the **Fisher Information** $\mathcal{I}(\rho) = \int \rho \|\nabla \ln \rho\|_G^2 \, d\mu_G$ {cite}`amari2016information`. Under the optimal transport scaling $v = -T_c \nabla \ln \rho$ (gradient flow of the free energy), we recover the de Bruijn identity {cite}`stam1959some` and the bound follows. The reaction term satisfies an analogous inequality via the $L^2(\rho)$ norm. See {ref}`Appendix E.3 <sec-appendix-e-rigorous-proof-sketches-for-ontological-and-metabolic-laws>` for the full proof. $\square$

*Remark (Landauer's Principle).* The classical Landauer bound states that erasing one bit of information requires dissipating at least $k_B T \ln 2$ joules of heat. Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-generalized-landauer-bound` is the information-geometric generalization: reducing belief entropy by $\Delta H$ nats requires dissipating at least $T_c \cdot |\Delta H|$ nats of metabolic energy.

:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
This theorem is really quite profound, and I want to make sure you appreciate what it is saying.

Landauer discovered something remarkable in 1961: you cannot erase information for free. If you have a bit that could be 0 or 1, and you reset it to 0, you must dump at least $k_B T \ln 2$ of heat into the environment. This is not an engineering limitation---it is a fundamental law of physics, a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

What we have done here is generalize Landauer's insight to continuous belief distributions on a Riemannian manifold. Instead of bits, we have probability densities. Instead of erasure, we have entropy reduction (becoming more certain). And the bound says: the rate at which you can become more certain is limited by the rate at which you dissipate metabolic energy.

Here is the intuitive picture. Your belief starts spread out (high entropy, uncertainty). As you think and process information, your belief concentrates (low entropy, certainty). But concentrating probability is like compressing a gas---you have to do work against the natural tendency for things to spread out. That work shows up as metabolic cost.

The temperature $T_c$ plays the role of a conversion factor. At high cognitive temperature, the agent explores more freely; at low temperature, it exploits what it knows. The Landauer bound tells us that reducing entropy at high temperature costs more than at low temperature---which makes intuitive sense, because at high temperature the probability distribution is fighting harder to stay spread out.
:::

:::{admonition} Example: The Cost of Certainty
:class: feynman-added tip

Suppose the agent starts with a uniform belief over 100 possible states (entropy $H = \ln 100 \approx 4.6$ nats) and wants to narrow down to just 10 possible states (entropy $H = \ln 10 \approx 2.3$ nats).

The entropy reduction is $\Delta H \approx 2.3$ nats. By the Landauer bound, the minimum metabolic cost is:

$$
\Psi_{\text{met}} \ge T_c \cdot |\Delta H| = 2.3 \, T_c \text{ nats}

$$

If $T_c = 1$, that is about 2.3 nats of metabolic energy. If $T_c = 0.1$ (a more "decisive" agent), the cost drops to 0.23 nats---but recall that low temperature also means less exploration.

This is the fundamental tradeoff: certainty costs energy, and the price depends on how "hot" your thinking process is.

**In Physics:** Erasing one bit of information requires dissipating at least $k_B T \ln 2$ joules of heat. More generally, reducing entropy by $\Delta S$ requires work $W \geq T|\Delta S|$ {cite}`landauer1961irreversibility,bennett1982thermodynamics`.

**In Implementation:** The generalized Landauer bound (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-generalized-landauer-bound`):

:::{admonition} Connection to RL #14: Maximum Expected Utility as Zero-Temperature Limit
:class: note
:name: conn-rl-14
**The General Law (Fragile Agent):**
The agent optimizes a **Free Energy** objective that includes the metabolic cost of computation:

$$
\mathcal{F}[p, \pi] = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} p(z) \Big( V(z) - T_c H(\pi(\cdot|z)) \Big) d\mu_G - \Psi_{\text{met}}

$$
where $\Psi_{\text{met}} = \int_0^S \dot{\mathcal{M}}(s)\,ds$ is the cumulative metabolic energy. The agent stops thinking when marginal returns equal marginal costs.

**The Degenerate Limit:**
Set $T_c \to 0$ (computational temperature zero). Compute is free and infinite.

**The Special Case (Standard RL):**

$$
J(\pi) = \max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t\right]

$$
This recovers standard **Maximum Expected Utility**---the objective used in DQN, PPO, SAC, etc.

**Result:** Standard RL ignores the thermodynamic cost of inference. The agent assumes it has infinite compute and can think forever. The Fragile Agent has an irreducible "cost of thinking" governed by the Landauer bound.

**What the generalization offers:**
- Principled stopping: deliberation ends when $\Gamma(S^*) = \dot{\mathcal{M}}(S^*)$ (marginal return = marginal cost)
- Fast/Slow phase transition: System 1 ($S^*=0$) vs System 2 ($S^*>0$) from first principles
- Landauer bound: $\dot{\mathcal{M}} \ge T_c |\dot{H}|$---thinking has irreducible thermodynamic cost

(sec-the-metabolic-potential-and-deliberation-action)=
## The Metabolic Potential and Deliberation Action

We introduce the metabolic cost as a coordinate in the agent's extended state space.

:::{div} feynman-prose
Now we come to the central construction of this section. We have established that thinking costs energy. The next question is: how does the agent decide when to stop?

The answer is beautiful in its simplicity. We define an **action**---in the physicist's sense, not the agent's sense---that captures the tradeoff between value gained and energy spent. The agent then finds the computation time $S^*$ that extremizes this action.

Think of it like this. Suppose you are trying to decide where to eat dinner. You could think about it for one second and pick something adequate. Or you could spend an hour researching restaurants and find something excellent. But at some point, the improvement in your dinner is not worth the additional time spent deciding. The Deliberation Action formalizes exactly this tradeoff.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Metabolic Potential
:label: def-metabolic-potential

We define $\Psi_{\text{met}}(s) := \int_0^s \dot{\mathcal{M}}(u) \, du$ as the cumulative metabolic energy dissipated during a single interaction step $t$ for an internal rollout of duration $s$. Units: $[\Psi_{\text{met}}] = \text{nat}$.

:::
:::{prf:axiom} Dual-Horizon Action
:label: ax-dual-horizon-action

For any interaction step $t$, the agent selects a total computation budget $S \in [0, S_{\max}]$ that minimizes the **Deliberation Action** $\mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}$:

$$
\mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}[S] = -\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \rho_S} [V(z)]}_{\text{Expected Terminal Value}} + \underbrace{\Psi_{\text{met}}(S)}_{\text{Computational Cost}},

$$
where $V(z)$ is the task potential ({ref}`Section 24.2 <sec-hodge-decomposition-of-value>`). Units: $[\mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}] = \text{nat}$.

*Physical interpretation:* The agent faces a trade-off: longer deliberation ($S$ large) improves the expected value $\langle V \rangle_{\rho_S}$ by refining the belief toward high-value regions, but incurs greater metabolic cost $\Psi_{\text{met}}(S)$. The optimal $S^*$ balances these competing pressures.

*Remark (Sign convention).* We write $-\langle V \rangle$ because the agent seeks to **maximize** value. The Deliberation Action $\mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}$ is minimized when value is maximized and cost is minimized.

:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me explain why we call this the "Dual-Horizon Action."

In ordinary reinforcement learning, there is one horizon: the time horizon over which the agent collects rewards in the world. The discount factor $\gamma$ controls how far into the future the agent looks.

But the Fragile Agent has a second horizon: the **computation horizon**. This is the internal time $s$ over which the agent thinks before acting. And just as the external horizon has a "discount" in the form of $\gamma$, the internal horizon has a "discount" in the form of metabolic cost.

The Deliberation Action captures both:
- **Expected Terminal Value** $\langle V \rangle_{\rho_S}$: This is what the agent expects to get from acting after thinking for time $S$. As $S$ increases, the belief $\rho_S$ concentrates on high-value regions, so this term increases (the minus sign means decreasing action, which is good).
- **Metabolic Cost** $\Psi_{\text{met}}(S)$: This is what the agent pays to think for time $S$. It increases with $S$.

The optimal $S^*$ is where these two competing effects balance. Think too little, and you leave value on the table. Think too much, and you waste energy chasing diminishing returns.
:::

:::{note}
:class: feynman-added

**Why "Action" and not "Loss"?**

In physics, the action is a functional whose stationary points give the equations of motion. This is the Principle of Least Action, one of the most powerful ideas in all of physics.

By framing deliberation as an action principle, we connect the agent's internal computation to the same variational framework that governs classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory. The optimal computation time $S^*$ is not found by gradient descent on a loss---it emerges from stationarity of the action, just like a particle's trajectory emerges from stationarity of the Lagrangian action.

This is not just a fancy rebranding. The action formulation gives us access to all the machinery of variational calculus: Euler-Lagrange equations, Noether's theorem, Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The Deliberation Action is the starting point for a full Lagrangian mechanics of cognition.

(sec-optimal-deliberation-the-fast-slow-law)=
## Optimal Deliberation: The Fast/Slow Law

We now prove the existence of an optimal "stopping time" for internal thought.

:::{div} feynman-prose
This is where it gets exciting. We are going to derive the precise condition for when the agent should stop thinking, and then show that this condition leads to two fundamentally different behavioral regimes---corresponding to "fast" and "slow" thinking.

The mathematics is going to tell us something that psychologists have observed empirically: sometimes you should think fast (System 1), and sometimes you should think slow (System 2). But unlike the psychological literature, we will derive the exact transition point between these regimes from first principles.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Deliberation Optimality Condition
:label: thm-deliberation-optimality-condition

Let $\rho_s$ evolve as a gradient flow of $V$ under WFR dynamics. The optimal computation budget $S^*$ satisfies:

$$
\left. \frac{d}{ds} \langle V \rangle_{\rho_s} \right|_{s=S^*} = \dot{\mathcal{M}}(S^*),

$$
provided such an $S^*$ exists in $(0, S_{\max})$.

*Proof.* We seek to extremize $\mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}$ with respect to the upper integration limit $S$. By the Leibniz Integral Rule and the definition of $\Psi_{\text{met}}$:

$$
\frac{d}{dS} \mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}} = -\frac{d}{dS} \langle V \rangle_{\rho_S} + \dot{\mathcal{M}}(S).

$$
The first term is the **Value-Improvement Rate**:

$$
\frac{d}{dS} \langle V \rangle_{\rho_S} = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} V(z) \partial_s \rho(S, z) \, d\mu_G.

$$
Applying the WFR continuity equation $\partial_s \rho = \rho r - \nabla \cdot (\rho v)$:

$$
\frac{d}{dS} \langle V \rangle_{\rho_S} = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} V \cdot \rho r \, d\mu_G + \int_{\mathcal{Z}} V (-\nabla \cdot (\rho v)) \, d\mu_G.

$$
Integrating the divergence term by parts (assuming vanishing flux at $\partial\mathcal{Z}$):

$$
\int_{\mathcal{Z}} V (-\nabla \cdot (\rho v)) \, d\mu_G = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} \rho \langle \nabla V, v \rangle_G \, d\mu_G.

$$
For gradient flow dynamics, $v = -G^{-1} \nabla V$ (up to temperature scaling), so $\langle \nabla V, v \rangle_G = -\|\nabla V\|_G^2 \le 0$. Thus:

$$
\frac{d}{dS} \langle V \rangle_{\rho_S} = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} \rho \left( V r - \|\nabla V\|_G^2 \right) d\mu_G.

$$
The stationarity condition $\frac{d}{dS} \mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}} = 0$ yields the optimality condition. See {ref}`Appendix E.4 <sec-appendix-e-rigorous-proof-sketches-for-ontological-and-metabolic-laws>` for the full proof using the WFR adjoint operator. $\square$

*Physical interpretation:* The optimal stopping time $S^*$ is reached when the marginal gain in expected value (the "return on thinking") exactly equals the marginal metabolic cost (the "price of thinking"). At $S^*$, the agent has extracted all cost-effective information from deliberation.

:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
This optimality condition is wonderfully intuitive once you see it.

The agent keeps thinking as long as each additional moment of thought produces more value than it costs. The moment the marginal value gain drops to equal the marginal metabolic cost, the agent stops and acts.

Let me give you an analogy. Imagine you are mining gold. Each hour of digging costs you some amount in effort (the metabolic cost). And each hour produces some amount of gold (the value improvement). As you dig, the easy gold gets extracted first, so the rate of gold production falls. At some point, the gold you are getting per hour is worth less than the effort of digging. That is when you stop.

The equation $\Gamma(S^*) = \dot{\mathcal{M}}(S^*)$ says exactly this: stop thinking when the marginal value of thought equals the marginal cost of thought.

Now, here is what makes this subtle. The value improvement rate $\Gamma(s) = |\frac{d}{ds}\langle V \rangle|$ is not constant. It typically starts high (when you first start thinking, you quickly figure out the rough answer) and then decays (further thinking only refines details). Meanwhile, the metabolic cost $\dot{\mathcal{M}}(s)$ might be roughly constant or even increase (as the belief distribution becomes more concentrated and harder to refine).

The intersection of these two curves determines $S^*$. If the value improvement curve starts above the metabolic cost curve, there is a positive $S^* > 0$ where they cross. If it starts below, then $S^* = 0$---you should act immediately without thinking at all.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Fast/Slow Phase Transition
:label: thm-fast-slow-phase-transition

Let $\Gamma(s) := \left| \frac{d}{ds} \langle V \rangle_{\rho_s} \right|$ be the **Value-Improvement Rate**. There exists a critical threshold such that:

1. **Reflexive Regime (Fast):** If $\Gamma(0) < \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, then $S^* = 0$. The agent executes an immediate action based on the prior $\rho_0$.

2. **Deliberative Regime (Slow):** If $\Gamma(0) > \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, then $S^* > 0$. The agent enters a planning state, terminating only when the marginal gain in Value equals the marginal metabolic cost.

*Proof.* Consider the derivative of the Deliberation Action at $S = 0$:

$$
\left. \frac{d}{dS} \mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}} \right|_{S=0} = -\Gamma(0) + \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0).

$$
If $\Gamma(0) < \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, then $\frac{d}{dS} \mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}|_{S=0} > 0$. Since $\mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}$ is increasing at $S=0$ and we assume $\mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}$ is convex (which holds when $\Gamma(s)$ is decreasing due to diminishing returns), the minimum occurs at the boundary $S^* = 0$.

If $\Gamma(0) > \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, then $\frac{d}{dS} \mathcal{S}_{\text{delib}}|_{S=0} < 0$. The agent benefits from deliberation. As $s$ increases, $\Gamma(s)$ decreases (diminishing marginal returns on thinking) while $\dot{\mathcal{M}}(s)$ may increase or remain constant. The optimum $S^* > 0$ occurs when the curves cross: $\Gamma(S^*) = \dot{\mathcal{M}}(S^*)$. $\square$

*Remark (Dual-Process Theory).* Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-fast-slow-phase-transition` provides a first-principles derivation of Kahneman's "System 1 / System 2" dichotomy {cite}`kahneman2011thinking`. System 1 (reflexive) corresponds to $S^* = 0$; System 2 (deliberative) corresponds to $S^* > 0$. The transition is not a cognitive style but a phase transition governed by the ratio $\Gamma(0) / \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$.

:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
This is, I think, one of the most satisfying results in this entire framework. Let me explain why.

Psychologists have long observed that human cognition operates in two modes: fast, automatic, intuitive thinking (System 1) and slow, effortful, deliberate thinking (System 2). Kahneman won a Nobel Prize in part for characterizing these systems. But until now, this was an empirical observation---a description of how we think, not an explanation of why.

What we have shown is that these two modes are not separate cognitive systems. They are **phases** of a single physical system, like ice and water. The transition between them is governed by a simple ratio: the initial value improvement rate $\Gamma(0)$ versus the initial metabolic cost $\dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$.

When is System 1 optimal? When the task is familiar, the prior $\rho_0$ is already close to optimal, and thinking would only burn energy without much improvement. Then $\Gamma(0) < \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, and the agent should act immediately.

When is System 2 optimal? When the task is novel, the stakes are high, and the initial belief is far from optimal. Then $\Gamma(0) > \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, and deliberation pays off.

The beautiful thing is that the same agent, in the same moment, can be in either regime depending on the situation. There is no need for two separate systems, two separate neural architectures, two separate decision rules. The physics tells you which regime you are in.
:::

:::{admonition} Example: When to Think Fast vs. Slow
:class: feynman-added example

**Scenario 1: Catching a Ball**

You see a ball flying toward you. Your prior $\rho_0$ (from years of catching balls) is already concentrated on the right action: put your hand where the ball will be. The value improvement from deliberation is tiny---$\Gamma(0) \approx 0$. Meanwhile, thinking costs time, and the ball is not going to wait. So $\Gamma(0) < \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, and you catch reflexively.

**Scenario 2: Buying a House**

You are considering a major purchase. Your prior $\rho_0$ is vague---there are hundreds of relevant factors you have not considered. The value improvement from deliberation is huge---$\Gamma(0) \gg 0$. The metabolic cost of thinking is real but small compared to the cost of a bad decision. So $\Gamma(0) > \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$, and you deliberate for weeks.

The same agent, the same decision rule, wildly different behavior---all determined by the initial ratio $\Gamma(0)/\dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$.

:::{prf:theorem} Generalized Stopping for Non-Conservative Fields
:label: thm-generalized-stopping

When the Value Curl does not vanish ($\mathcal{F} \neq 0$, Definition {prf:ref}`def-value-curl`), the agent converges to a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-ness-existence`) rather than a fixed point. The stopping criterion generalizes as follows:

**Conservative Case ($\mathcal{F} = 0$):** Stop when the Value-Improvement Rate equals the metabolic cost:

$$
\Gamma(S^*) = \dot{\mathcal{M}}(S^*)

$$

**Non-Conservative Case ($\mathcal{F} \neq 0$):** Stop when the **orbit parameters converge**:

$$
\frac{d}{ds}\|\text{Orbit}(s)\|_{\text{param}} < \epsilon_{\text{orbit}}

$$
even if the agent continues moving within the limit cycle.

*Remark.* In the conservative case, convergence is to a fixed point ($\dot{z} \to 0$). In the non-conservative case, convergence is to a stable limit cycle (periodic orbit with constant parameters).

**Operational Criterion:** Define the orbit-change metric as:

$$
\Delta_{\text{orbit}}(s) := \left\| \oint_{\gamma_s} \mathcal{R} - \oint_{\gamma_{s-\delta}} \mathcal{R} \right\|

$$
where $\gamma_s$ is the closed trajectory over one cycle at time $s$. Stop when $\Delta_{\text{orbit}}(s) < \epsilon_{\text{orbit}}$.

*Remark.* In the non-conservative case, the agent accumulates reward along periodic trajectories. Deliberation terminates when the orbit parameters stabilize, not when motion ceases.

Everything I said about stopping when marginal value equals marginal cost assumes the value field is **conservative**---meaning there is a single scalar value function $V(z)$, and moving around closed loops collects zero net reward.

But what if the value field has curl? What if there are cyclic preference structures, like rock-paper-scissors? In that case, there is no fixed point to converge to. The belief does not settle down; it orbits.

Does this mean the agent should think forever? No! Even in the non-conservative case, there is an optimal stopping time. It is just that the criterion changes.

Instead of waiting for the belief to stop moving, the agent waits for the **orbit to stabilize**. The belief might still be circulating around a limit cycle, but the shape and size of that cycle are no longer changing. At that point, further deliberation is not improving anything---the agent has found the best orbit it is going to find, and it should start harvesting reward by moving along it.

This is a subtle but important generalization. Standard RL assumes conservative rewards; real-world preferences often are not. The Fragile Agent handles both cases with a unified stopping criterion.

:::{admonition} Connection to RL #15: UCB as Degenerate Thermodynamic VOI
:class: note
:name: conn-rl-15
**The General Law (Fragile Agent):**
The agent explores based on the **Thermodynamic Value of Information**:

$$
\text{VOI}(a) := \mathbb{E}[\Delta H(\rho) \mid a] - \frac{1}{T_c} \dot{\mathcal{M}}(a)

$$
Exploration is justified when the expected entropy reduction exceeds the metabolic cost.

**The Degenerate Limit:**
Assume a **single-state manifold** (no dynamics, stateless bandit). Use simplified Gaussian uncertainty.

**The Special Case (Multi-Armed Bandits):**

$$
a^* = \arg\max_a \left[ \hat{\mu}_a + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{n_a}} \right]

$$
This recovers **UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound)**. The exploration bonus $c\sqrt{\ln t / n_a}$ is the specific solution to the Landauer inequality for Gaussian arm distributions.

**Result:** UCB is the **thermodynamics of a single point**---exploration when there's no state, no dynamics, just uncertainty about arm means. The Fragile Agent generalizes to full manifold dynamics where exploration depends on local geometry.

**What the generalization offers:**
- State-dependent exploration: VOI varies with position $z$ on the manifold
- Geometric awareness: exploration bonus depends on local curvature $G(z)$
- Deliberation-aware: exploration trades off against computational cost $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$

## The H-Theorem for Open Cognitive Systems

We reconcile computation with the Second Law of Thermodynamics {cite}`crooks1999entropy,parrondo2015thermodynamics`.

:::{div} feynman-prose
You might be wondering: how does all this relate to the Second Law of Thermodynamics? After all, when the agent reduces its belief entropy (becomes more certain), is not that a violation of the tendency for entropy to increase?

The answer, of course, is no. The Second Law applies to **closed** systems. The agent is an **open** system---it takes in energy (metabolic fuel) and uses that energy to reduce its internal entropy while increasing entropy elsewhere.

What we are going to show is that the total entropy production---internal entropy change plus the "entropy cost" of metabolic dissipation---is always non-negative. The agent can become more certain, but only by paying the thermodynamic piper.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Total Entropy Production
:label: thm-total-entropy-production

The total entropy production rate of the agent $\sigma_{\text{tot}}$ during computation is:

$$
\sigma_{\text{tot}}(s) := \frac{d}{ds} H(\rho_s) + \frac{1}{T_c} \dot{\mathcal{M}}(s) \ge 0.

$$
*Proof.* From Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-generalized-landauer-bound`, $\dot{\mathcal{M}}(s) \ge T_c |\frac{d}{ds} H(\rho_s)|$. If $\frac{d}{ds} H < 0$ (entropy decreasing), then:

$$
\sigma_{\text{tot}} = \frac{dH}{ds} + \frac{\dot{\mathcal{M}}}{T_c} \ge \frac{dH}{ds} + \left| \frac{dH}{ds} \right| = \frac{dH}{ds} - \frac{dH}{ds} = 0.

$$
If $\frac{d}{ds} H \ge 0$, then $\sigma_{\text{tot}} \ge 0$ trivially since $\dot{\mathcal{M}} \ge 0$. $\square$

*Interpretation:* The agent can only reduce its internal uncertainty ($dH/ds < 0$) by dissipating metabolic energy ($\dot{\mathcal{M}} > 0$) {cite}`still2012thermodynamics`. This defines the **Efficiency of Thought**:

$$
\eta_{\text{thought}} := \frac{-T_c \cdot dH/ds}{\dot{\mathcal{M}}} \le 1.

$$
An agent is "thermodynamically fragile" if it requires high metabolic flux for low entropy reduction ($\eta_{\text{thought}} \ll 1$).

:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
This theorem is the cognitive version of the H-theorem from statistical mechanics. Boltzmann showed that entropy increases for isolated systems; we are showing that total entropy production is non-negative for open cognitive systems.

The efficiency of thought $\eta_{\text{thought}}$ is a beautiful quantity. It measures how close the agent comes to the thermodynamic limit. An efficiency of 1 means the agent is operating reversibly---every bit of metabolic energy goes directly into reducing belief entropy, with no waste. An efficiency near 0 means the agent is terribly inefficient---burning lots of energy to achieve only small reductions in uncertainty.

Real agents, of course, operate somewhere in between. And here is the key insight: the Landauer bound gives us an absolute limit on efficiency. No matter how clever the agent's algorithms, it cannot exceed $\eta_{\text{thought}} = 1$. This is not an engineering constraint; it is a law of physics.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Cognitive Carnot Efficiency
:label: def-cognitive-carnot-efficiency

The **Carnot limit** for cognitive systems is $\eta_{\text{thought}} = 1$, achieved when the belief update is a reversible isothermal process. Real agents operate at $\eta_{\text{thought}} < 1$ due to:
1. **Friction:** Non-optimal transport paths (geodesic deviation)
2. **Irreversibility:** Finite-rate updates (non-quasi-static processes)
3. **Dissipation:** Exploration noise ($T_c > 0$)

:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
Why do we call this the "Carnot efficiency"?

In thermodynamics, Carnot showed that heat engines have a maximum possible efficiency that depends only on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs. No engine can exceed this limit, no matter how cleverly designed. It is a consequence of the Second Law.

The Cognitive Carnot Efficiency plays the same role for thinking agents. The Landauer bound tells us that reducing entropy by $|\Delta H|$ costs at least $T_c |\Delta H|$ in metabolic energy. An agent that achieves exactly this minimum is operating at Carnot efficiency.

In practice, there are three sources of inefficiency:

1. **Friction:** The agent might not take the geodesic path through belief space. Imagine you are trying to concentrate your belief from point A to point B. The shortest path (the geodesic) costs the minimum energy. Any deviation costs more.

2. **Irreversibility:** Quasi-static processes (infinitely slow changes) are reversible. Finite-rate processes are not. When the agent updates its beliefs quickly, it dissipates more energy than the Landauer minimum.

3. **Exploration noise:** At finite temperature $T_c > 0$, the agent explores. This exploration injects entropy back into the belief, counteracting the entropy reduction from deliberation. It is like trying to cool a room while someone keeps opening the windows.

Understanding these inefficiencies is crucial for designing efficient agents. The thermodynamic framework does not just give us limits; it tells us where the losses are coming from.

:class: feynman-added

**On Thermodynamic Fragility**

An agent is "thermodynamically fragile" when its thinking efficiency $\eta_{\text{thought}}$ is low---it burns lots of energy to achieve only modest reductions in uncertainty.

This is dangerous for two reasons:

1. **Energy waste:** The agent depletes its metabolic budget quickly, potentially running out of "thinking fuel" when it matters most.

2. **Slow convergence:** Low efficiency means the agent takes longer to reach good beliefs. In time-critical situations, this can be fatal.

The diagnostic Node 51 (MetabolicEfficiencyCheck) monitors exactly this quantity. If $\eta_{\text{thought}}$ drops too low, the agent may be in "deliberative deadlock"---spinning its wheels without making progress.

(sec-diagnostic-nodes-b)=
## Diagnostic Nodes 51--52

Following the diagnostic node convention ({ref}`Section 3.1 <sec-theory-thin-interfaces>`), we define two new monitors for metabolic efficiency.

:::{div} feynman-prose
The theory is beautiful, but how do we know if an actual agent is behaving according to these principles? We need diagnostics---measurable quantities that tell us if things are working correctly.

Here we define two diagnostic nodes. The first checks whether the agent is getting good "return on investment" from its thinking. The second checks whether the Landauer bound is being respected---a violation would indicate something is deeply wrong with the physics of the computation.

**Interpretation:** Monitors the **Return on Investment** of deliberation. High $\eta_{\text{ROI}}$ indicates efficient thinking; low $\eta_{\text{ROI}}$ indicates the agent is "daydreaming"---expending compute without improving terminal value.

**Threshold:** $\eta_{\text{ROI}} > \eta_{\text{min}}$ (typical default $\eta_{\text{min}} = 0.1$).

**Trigger conditions:**
- Low MetabolicEfficiencyCheck: The agent is in deliberative deadlock (Mode C.C: Decision Paralysis).
- **Remediation:** Apply **SurgCC** (time-boxing): force $S \le S_{\text{cap}}$ to bound deliberation.

| **52** | **LandauerViolationCheck** | Dynamics      | Update Stability | Is the update thermodynamically valid? | $\delta_L := \dot{\mathcal{M}} + T_c \frac{dH}{ds}$ | $O(d)$   |

**Interpretation:** Monitors the Landauer bound (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-generalized-landauer-bound`). A violation ($\delta_L < 0$) indicates entropy is decreasing faster than metabolic dissipation permits---a non-physical update.

**Threshold:** $\delta_L \ge -\epsilon_L$ (typical default $\epsilon_L = 10^{-4}$).

**Trigger conditions:**
- Negative LandauerViolationCheck: Non-physical belief update detected.
- **Cause:** Numerical errors in the WFR solver, unstable metric $G$, or incorrectly estimated entropy.
- **Remediation:** Reduce integration step size; verify metric positive-definiteness; check entropy estimator calibration.

*Cross-reference:* Node 52 extends the thermodynamic consistency checks of {ref}`Section 23.4 <sec-the-belief-evolution-cycle-perception-dreaming-action>` (ThermoCycleCheck, Node 33) to the internal deliberation loop.

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me say a word about the Landauer Violation Check, because it is unusual to have a diagnostic that checks for violations of physics.

In most simulations, the laws of physics are hardcoded. Particles conserve momentum because the integrator is written to conserve momentum. But the Fragile Agent learns its dynamics, and learned dynamics can violate physical constraints.

The Landauer bound is one such constraint. If the agent's belief entropy is decreasing faster than its metabolic energy expenditure permits, something is wrong. Either the entropy estimator is broken, or the metabolic cost computation is wrong, or the WFR solver has gone haywire.

When this diagnostic triggers, do not try to fix it by patching the numbers. Fix the underlying bug. The Landauer bound is a law of nature; if your agent is violating it, your agent is broken.

**Key Results:**
1. **Landauer Bound (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-generalized-landauer-bound`):** $\dot{\mathcal{M}} \ge T_c |\dot{H}|$---thinking has a thermodynamic cost.
2. **Optimal Deliberation (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-deliberation-optimality-condition`):** $S^*$ satisfies $\Gamma(S^*) = \dot{\mathcal{M}}(S^*)$---stop thinking when marginal returns equal marginal costs.
3. **Phase Transition (Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-fast-slow-phase-transition`):** Fast ($S^* = 0$) vs. Slow ($S^* > 0$) is determined by $\Gamma(0) \lessgtr \dot{\mathcal{M}}(0)$.

**Conclusion.** Computational Metabolism provides the "biological" limit for the Fragile Agent. By deriving $S^*$ from first principles, we transform the "Thinking Fast vs. Slow" heuristic into a rigorous physical law. The agent acts not when it is "ready," but when it is no longer metabolically efficient to continue refining its belief. This framework connects to the free energy principle {cite}`friston2010free` and active inference {cite}`friston2017active`, providing a thermodynamic foundation for bounded rationality.

:::{div} feynman-prose
And there you have it. We started with a simple question---how long should you think before you act?---and ended up with a complete thermodynamic theory of deliberation.

The key insights are:

1. **Thinking costs energy.** This is not a metaphor; it is a physical fact, grounded in Landauer's principle.

2. **The optimal thinking time minimizes an action.** Value gained minus energy spent, with stationarity giving the stopping condition.

3. **Fast and slow thinking are phases of a single system.** The transition is governed by the ratio of initial value improvement to initial metabolic cost.

4. **The Second Law still holds.** Total entropy production is non-negative; agents can only reduce internal entropy by dissipating energy externally.

This framework does not just describe behavior; it constrains it. An agent that violates the Landauer bound is physically impossible. An agent that ignores metabolic costs will waste resources on pointless deliberation. The thermodynamics is not optional---it is the substrate on which all cognition must run.

For practical implementation, this means two things. First, track your metabolic costs. Know how much energy your agent is spending on computation, and make that part of the objective. Second, use the optimal stopping condition. Do not deliberate until some arbitrary timeout; stop when marginal value equals marginal cost.

The physics will guide you if you let it.
