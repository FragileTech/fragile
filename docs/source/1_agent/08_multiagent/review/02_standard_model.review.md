## Detailed findings
No findings.

## Scope restrictions and clarifications
- The spinor/QFT sections operate under the 4D globally hyperbolic spin (or spin^c) manifold assumption in def-loc-spin-g; outside this scope, the chirality/gamma^5 constructions must be adapted.
- Explicit mass-mixing formulas (W^\pm/Z/A^(0)) are specialized to the minimal r=2 case; general r requires diagonalizing the quadratic form as already noted in text.

## Proposed edits (optional)
- None.

## Open questions
- None.
