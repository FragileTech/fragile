# Proof: Geometric Ergodicity of the Backbone

:::{prf:theorem} Geometric Ergodicity of the Backbone
:label: proof-thm-backbone-convergence

For the backbone system (adaptive forces disabled), there exist constants
$\kappa_{\text{backbone}} > 0$ and $C_{\text{backbone}} < \infty$ such that

$$
\mathbb{E}[V_{\text{total}}(S_{k+1}) \mid S_k]
\le (1-\kappa_{\text{backbone}}) V_{\text{total}}(S_k) + C_{\text{backbone}},
$$

where $V_{\text{total}}$ is the composite Lyapunov functional. Consequently, the backbone
chain is geometrically ergodic and converges exponentially fast to its unique QSD.

:::{prf:proof}
The backbone dynamics is the kinetic Langevin evolution composed with cloning but without
adaptive forces or viscous coupling. The framework provides explicit drift inequalities for
each Lyapunov component:

- **Cloning drift**: Appendix {doc}`../03_cloning` gives contraction bounds for the
  variance and reward-related components under the cloning operator.
- **Kinetic drift**: Appendix {doc}`../05_kinetic_contraction` gives contraction bounds for
  the velocity variance and the mean-distance component under the kinetic operator.

Because $V_{\text{total}}$ is a fixed positive combination of these components, we choose the
weights so the negative drift terms dominate the bounded positive cross terms (AM-GM/Cauchy-Schwarz
as in the component proofs). Summing the two drift inequalities yields a continuous-time
Foster-Lyapunov inequality for $V_{\text{total}}$ with constants
$\tilde{\kappa}_{\text{backbone}}$ and $\tilde{C}_{\text{backbone}}$.

The discrete-time backbone chain is generated by the BAOAB splitting. Appendix
{doc}`../06_convergence` shows that the continuous-time drift transfers to the discrete
step, giving constants $\kappa_{\text{backbone}} \in (0,1)$ and $C_{\text{backbone}} < \infty$
with the stated inequality.

Finally, the standard Foster-Lyapunov plus minorization criteria in {doc}`../06_convergence`
yield geometric ergodicity and uniqueness of the QSD for the backbone chain. \(\square\)
