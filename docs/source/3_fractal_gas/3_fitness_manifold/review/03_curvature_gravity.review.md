## Detailed findings

### [E-001] Holonomy-curvature results rely on external theorems
- Location: sec-parallel-transport-holonomy (thm-ambrose-singer, lem-holonomy-small-loops)
- Severity: Major
- Type: External dependency (secondary: Proof gap / omission)
- Claim (paraphrase): Holonomy algebra is generated by curvature, and small-loop holonomy equals R * area plus higher-order terms, justified via non-abelian Stokes.
- Why this is an error in the framework: The chapter treats the Volume 3 framework as the ground truth, but both Ambrose-Singer and the non-abelian Stokes expansion are imported from external sources without internal permits. These results are foundational to the holonomy-curvature link used later in thm-riemann-scutoid.
- Impact on downstream results: The holonomy-to-curvature bridge is unsupported inside the framework, so thm-riemann-scutoid and its error estimate lack a certified foundation.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Add explicit Volume 3 permits/lemmas for (a) the holonomy algebra generation claim and (b) the small-loop expansion with remainder control.
  2. If the framework cannot derive these, mark them as external permits and clearly label the dependency at each use site.
  3. Record the required regularity hypotheses (connection smoothness, bounded curvature derivatives, small-loop scaling) in the statement.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): Internal permit for holonomy algebra generation; internal lemma for small-loop holonomy expansion with error bound.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: In normal coordinates on a convex normal neighborhood, expand parallel transport along a geodesic rectangle; show first-order area term equals R(X,Y) and bound the remainder by curvature-derivative control. Then show that the span over transported curvature operators generates the holonomy algebra.
- Validation plan: Trace all uses of thm-ambrose-singer and lem-holonomy-small-loops; confirm thm-riemann-scutoid cites the new permits and inherits their hypotheses.

### [E-002] Riemann-Scutoid correspondence lacks a discrete holonomy definition
- Location: sec-riemann-scutoid-dictionary (thm-riemann-scutoid)
- Severity: Major
- Type: Proof gap / omission (secondary: Scope restriction)
- Claim (paraphrase): The Riemann tensor is recovered as a limit of scutoid plaquette holonomy, with O(A^{1/2}) error under bounded curvature derivatives.
- Why this is an error in the framework: The theorem applies lem-holonomy-small-loops (a smooth-loop statement) to a discrete scutoid plaquette, but it never defines the discrete holonomy operator H[Pi] or establishes that the plaquette converges to a smooth loop in the required sense. The scaling of A_Pi with dt and neighbor spacing is not specified, so the limit is ill-posed.
- Impact on downstream results: The core dictionary linking discrete cloning geometry to continuous curvature is unverified; later claims about curvature recovery cannot be certified.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Define the discrete holonomy operator H[Pi] using the same transport rule as the discrete connection recovery (e.g., piecewise geodesic parallel transport or a CST transport rule).
  2. State a convergence lemma: as dt -> 0 and edge length -> 0 with a specified scaling (e.g., dt = O(epsilon_N)), the discrete loop converges to a smooth loop with controlled deviation.
  3. Prove an error bound that combines the smooth holonomy expansion with the discrete-to-smooth loop deviation.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): Regularity of walker trajectories (C^2), bounded curvature derivatives, mesh regularity, and a scaling relation between dt and epsilon_N.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: In geodesic normal coordinates at z, represent the plaquette edges as short geodesic segments with perturbations; compare discrete transport to continuous transport along the ideal geodesic rectangle; apply the small-loop expansion and bound the perturbation error by dt and epsilon_N.
- Validation plan: Check that the derived error bound is consistent with the stated O(A^{1/2}) term and the discrete Raychaudhuri scaling.

### [E-003] Metric signature is inconsistent with timelike/SEC usage
- Location: sec-parallel-transport-holonomy (Hol in O(d)), sec-raychaudhuri, sec-focusing-theorem (SEC, timelike u)
- Severity: Major
- Type: Conceptual (secondary: Definition mismatch)
- Claim (paraphrase): Holonomy lies in O(d) and Raychaudhuri/Focusing are stated for timelike geodesic congruences under the strong energy condition.
- Why this is an error in the framework: The emergent metric g = H + eps I is a positive-definite (Riemannian) object, yet the chapter uses Lorentzian language (timelike, SEC) and GR sign conventions. If the intended geometry is Lorentzian, the holonomy group should be O(1,d-1) and the metric definition must be updated accordingly; if it is Riemannian, timelike/SEC are undefined and focusing should be restated in Riemannian terms.
- Impact on downstream results: The interpretation of curvature, Raychaudhuri, and focusing is ambiguous and may be sign-inconsistent; the optimization-gravity correspondence becomes conceptually unstable.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Declare the intended signature explicitly: either (a) extend to a Lorentzian metric by adding a time coordinate with signature (-,+,...), or (b) remain Riemannian and replace timelike/SEC statements with Riemannian analogs.
  2. Update holonomy group, projector h_{mu nu}, and normalization of u to match the chosen signature.
  3. Adjust the focusing theorem statement and proof to the correct signature and hypotheses.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): A permit defining the Lorentzian extension (if chosen) or a Riemannian focusing lemma stated in Volume 3 terms.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: If Lorentzian, define g_L = -dt^2 + g and redo the kinematic decomposition with the correct sign; if Riemannian, state focusing in terms of Ricci curvature along unit-speed geodesics without causal language.
- Validation plan: Cross-check every appearance of timelike, SEC, and O(d) to ensure consistent signature and notation throughout the chapter.

### [E-004] Raychaudhuri theorem relies on external derivation
- Location: sec-raychaudhuri (thm-raychaudhuri proof)
- Severity: Major
- Type: External dependency (secondary: Proof gap / omission)
- Claim (paraphrase): The Raychaudhuri equation follows from a standard derivation in Wald.
- Why this is an error in the framework: Volume 3 requires internal permits for classical GR results; citing Wald imports the derivation without a framework basis. The theorem statement also omits explicit hypotheses (affine parametrization, geodesic flow, smoothness).
- Impact on downstream results: The discrete Raychaudhuri correspondence is grounded on a theorem that is not certified in the framework.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Restate thm-raychaudhuri with explicit hypotheses (geodesic congruence, affine parameter, C^2 velocity field).
  2. Add a Volume 3 permit/lemma deriving Raychaudhuri from the kinematic decomposition and Ricci identity within the framework.
  3. If the framework cannot derive it fully, mark it as an external permit and limit downstream claims accordingly.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): Internal permit for Ricci identity and kinematic decomposition interplay; smoothness bounds on u.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: Compute u^nu nabla_nu (nabla_mu u^mu), decompose nabla_mu u_nu into theta, sigma, omega, and invoke the commutator of covariant derivatives to obtain the Ricci term.
- Validation plan: Ensure thm-discrete-raychaudhuri references the revised theorem and inherits the correct hypotheses.

### [E-005] Discrete Raychaudhuri proof uses unpermitted transport tools
- Location: sec-discrete-raychaudhuri (thm-discrete-raychaudhuri proof, Steps 1-4)
- Severity: Major
- Type: Proof gap / external dependency (secondary: Parameter inconsistency)
- Claim (paraphrase): Reynolds transport + boundary velocity approximation + divergence theorem yield theta_i evolution with O(epsilon_N) error.
- Why this is an error in the framework: Reynolds transport for moving Voronoi cells in a curved manifold, the boundary velocity identity, and the divergence theorem with explicit remainder are not established in Volume 3. The boundary velocity estimate depends on geometric facts about Voronoi faces and midpoint displacement that are asserted but not derived. The scaling between dt and epsilon_N is also unstated, making the error bound ambiguous.
- Impact on downstream results: The discrete Raychaudhuri correspondence (a key theorem) lacks a framework-proof; error bounds may be inconsistent with the intended scaling.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Add a lemma for Reynolds transport on Voronoi cells in a manifold with bounded curvature and piecewise smooth boundary.
  2. Prove a boundary-velocity estimate for Voronoi faces in normal coordinates, explicitly bounding the midpoint displacement term by O(epsilon_N).
  3. State a scaling relation between dt and epsilon_N (e.g., dt = O(epsilon_N)) and propagate it through the error analysis.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): Voronoi face regularity, bounded curvature derivatives, and a coupling between time step and inter-particle spacing.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: Use geodesic normal coordinates at z_i to approximate Voronoi faces by hyperplanes; express boundary motion via implicit differentiation of distance functions; apply divergence theorem with a Taylor expansion remainder controlled by C^3 bounds on u.
- Validation plan: Check the resulting error term against the stated O(epsilon_N) bound and update the theorem statement if a higher-order term appears.

### [E-006] Connection recovery is circular and lacks error justification
- Location: sec-discrete-connection (def-edge-deformation, prop-connection-least-squares)
- Severity: Moderate
- Type: Algorithm mismatch (secondary: Proof gap / omission)
- Claim (paraphrase): Christoffel symbols are recovered by least squares using edge deformation with parallel transport P[gamma_i], achieving O(h) error.
- Why this is an error in the framework: The definition of edge deformation depends on parallel transport along gamma_i, which itself requires the connection to be known. This makes the estimator circular unless a computable discrete transport rule is specified. The O(h) error bound is asserted without a framework proof or stated assumptions on mesh regularity and time step.
- Impact on downstream results: The discrete connection recovery algorithm is not implementable as stated and the claimed accuracy is unsupported.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Define a computable discrete transport operator (e.g., using local frames from neighboring edges or a CST-compatible transport rule).
  2. Restate the estimator in terms of that operator and specify the required data (positions, velocities, dt).
  3. Prove or cite an internal lemma giving the O(h) error under explicit mesh and smoothness assumptions.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): Uniform neighbor distribution, bounded acceleration/curvature, and dt scaling with h.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: Linearize the transport equation over dt, show the residual is O(h) in normal coordinates, and bound the least-squares estimator error by the condition number of the local edge matrix.
- Validation plan: Test the estimator on a synthetic manifold with known Christoffel symbols and verify O(h) convergence.

### [E-007] Euler characteristic change under cloning is overstated
- Location: sec-curvature-topology (thm-curvature-topology, prop-curvature-change-2d)
- Severity: Moderate
- Type: Scope restriction (secondary: Invalid inference)
- Claim (paraphrase): Adding/removing a cell changes Euler characteristic by +/-1 in a bounded region, implying a fixed curvature jump.
- Why this is an error in the framework: Euler characteristic identities require a closed cell complex or explicit boundary terms. A typical cloning event is a Voronoi cell split that often preserves chi (Delta V - Delta E + Delta F = 0). The statement needs a precise topological operation and boundary conditions.
- Impact on downstream results: The claimed fixed curvature change (e.g., +/-2pi) may be incorrect or only valid under restricted boundary operations.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Specify the manifold topology (compact without boundary or periodic boundary conditions) and define the exact Voronoi update rule for cloning.
  2. Compute Delta V, Delta E, Delta F for that update and state the resulting Delta chi explicitly.
  3. If boundary effects are allowed, include the boundary correction term in Gauss-Bonnet and revise the curvature-change claim accordingly.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): A permit characterizing Voronoi updates under cloning and the associated Euler characteristic changes.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: Treat cloning as insertion of a new site and recomputation of the Voronoi complex; enumerate local combinatorial changes and show when Delta chi = 0 versus +/-1 depending on boundary updates.
- Validation plan: Check the formula against planar Voronoi examples (with and without periodic boundaries).

### [E-008] Notation and missing definitions in the scutoid plaquette section
- Location: def-scutoid-plaquette, thm-riemann-scutoid formula
- Severity: Minor
- Type: Notation conflict (secondary: Miswording)
- Claim (paraphrase): Area A_Pi approx ell * c * dt and holonomy uses T^c T^d as the tangent bivector.
- Why this is an error in the framework: The symbol c is undefined, and T^c T^d is ambiguous because the holonomy expansion should depend on an antisymmetric bivector; the current notation can be misread as a symmetric product.
- Impact on downstream results: Low; but it obscures the geometric meaning of the plaquette area and the curvature contraction.
- Fix guidance (step-by-step):
  1. Define c (e.g., a speed scale) or remove it and express A_Pi in terms of edge lengths only.
  2. Replace T^c T^d with an explicit bivector T^{cd} = T^c S^d - T^d S^c constructed from two independent edge directions.
  3. Add a short notation line clarifying the normalization of T^{cd}.
- Required new assumptions/permits (if any): None.
- Framework-first proof sketch for the fix: Notation-only clarification; no new proof required.
- Validation plan: Check dimensional consistency of A_Pi and ensure the contraction R^a_{bcd} V^b T^{cd} matches the small-loop expansion.

## Scope restrictions and clarifications
- The holonomy expansion and Riemann-Scutoid limit require explicit regularity and scaling assumptions (loop size, dt, and epsilon_N) to be stated.
- The Raychaudhuri and focusing statements require a declared metric signature (Riemannian vs Lorentzian) and consistent causal terminology.
- Euler characteristic arguments must specify boundary conditions or periodicity; otherwise include boundary correction terms.

## Proposed edits (optional)
- Add a short section defining the discrete holonomy operator H[Pi] and its convergence assumptions.
- Insert an explicit signature declaration (and update O(d) to O(1,d-1) if Lorentzian).
- Introduce Volume 3 permits for Raychaudhuri and small-loop holonomy (or mark them as external permits).

## Open questions
- Do we want a Lorentzian extension of the emergent metric, or a purely Riemannian reinterpretation of focusing?
- Is there an existing Volume 3 permit for Reynolds transport/divergence on Voronoi cells that should be referenced here?
