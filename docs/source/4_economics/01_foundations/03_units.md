# Units and Dimensional Conventions

- **Time:** measured in discrete steps or continuous time with step $\Delta t$.
- **Currency unit (CU):** all prices are in CU. A ratio of prices is dimensionless.
- **Information:** entropies and KL are measured in **nats**.
- **Rates:** interest rates and hazard rates are in $1/\text{time}$.
- **Free energy / certainty equivalents:** measured in CU when applied to payoffs; in nats when applied to log-prices or utility-based potentials.

Whenever a threshold $\epsilon$ appears, it inherits the units of the quantity it bounds.
