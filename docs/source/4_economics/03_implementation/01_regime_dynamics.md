# Market Understanding and Regime Dynamics

## Regime Switching

Let $K_t \in \{1,\dots,|\mathcal{K}|\}$ evolve via transition matrix $\Pi$. Asset drifts and volatilities are state-dependent:
$$
\mu_t = \mu_{K_t}, \quad \sigma_t = \sigma_{K_t}.
$$
Regime changes are audited via the Representation and Boundary permits.

## Liquidity and Leverage Cycles

Liquidity is a dynamic state variable. When leverage rises and liquidity falls, the system approaches BarrierLev and BarrierLiq. Pricing becomes **interval-valued** rather than point-valued.

## Macro Factors and Risk Appetite

Risk temperature $T_t$ reflects aggregate risk appetite. Higher $T_t$ implies lower risk aversion, higher asset prices, and higher entropy. Sieve checks ensure $T_t$ changes are grounded in observable data.
