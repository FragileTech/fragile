# Summary and Self-Consistency Checklist

A market pricing model is **self-consistent** if:
1. It admits a positive SDF consistent with observed prices.
2. It satisfies gate permits for solvency, liquidity, and information grounding.
3. It respects barrier constraints during stress.
4. Its macro state $K_t$ is stable, grounded, and within capacity.
5. Its thermoeconomic potential decreases under normal operation.

This is the operational definition of a **complete asset pricing theory** within the Fragile Market framework.
