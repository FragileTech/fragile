# Economies and Markets as Physical Systems

Treating finance as physics is not a metaphor: it is a commitment to a particular kind of model.
Physical systems are described by (i) conserved quantities, (ii) potentials, (iii) dissipation,
(iv) symmetries, and (v) admissibility conditions. The fragile mechanics machinery provides this
structure for economies.

## Conservation and balance laws

The “mass” in finance is balance-sheet mass: capital, collateral, and solvency capacity. It is not
strictly conserved because economies are open systems (issuance, defaults, policy injections), but
it obeys balance laws:

- **Continuity:** wealth/collateral moves through portfolios and institutions (transport).
- **Sources/sinks:** production, issuance, default, taxation (creation/destruction).
- **Dissipation:** impact, spreads, funding costs, bankruptcy costs (irreversibility).

## Temperature, entropy, and regimes

Empirically, markets exhibit phase-like behavior (risk-on/off, liquidity states, crisis regimes).
In the Fragile view, regimes are not just statistical clusters: they are **capacity states**:

- “hot” markets: high turnover, shallow beliefs, high entropy (fast mixing, noisy pricing),
- “cold” markets: concentrated beliefs, low entropy (slow switching, sticky allocations),
- crises: barrier events where the admissible manifold changes (defaults, margin spirals).

## Geometry is risk

Risk is not only a covariance matrix; it is geometry:

- The metric $G$ defines local conditioning and feasible motion.
- Curvature measures fragility: where small perturbations amplify.
- Transport costs encode liquidity and market impact.

This viewpoint forces every “risk model” to declare the geometry it assumes.

## Policy as boundary control

Macroeconomic policy is boundary control:
- central bank operations change funding boundary conditions,
- regulation changes admissible sets (barriers),
- fiscal policy injects sources/sinks (mass creation/redistribution).

In the standard model, these are not exogenous narrative layers; they are typed operations on
$B_t$, $\\mathfrak{D}$, and the Sieve.

## What this buys you

The payoff of the physics stance is unification:
- microstructure and macro regimes become coupled boundary/bulk phenomena,
- asset pricing, risk management, and financial stability share one typed language,
- “stress tests” become geometric/thermodynamic diagnostics rather than bespoke scenarios.
